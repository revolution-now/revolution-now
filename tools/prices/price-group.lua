-- This is the function that takes the two volumes (intrinsic
-- volume and traded volume) and from them derives the equilib-
-- rium prices (the prices toward which the actual player-visible
-- prices will tend toward). The basic idea is is that the equi-
-- librium prices are proportional to the inverses of the total
-- volumes. The OG appears to do this:
--
--   1. Get the total volume for each good, ignoring negative
--      traded volumes, as usual.
--   2. Normalize them so that their average is one, which will
--      allow scaling them to our desired target value.
--   3. Take the inverse of that normalized volume, which is pro-
--      portional to the price, then scale it up to the target
--      value (which is fixed at 12).
--
-- This process ensures that a couple of things:
--
--   1. The price of a good will generally go down when the vol-
--      umes go up, which makes sense because this is a basic
--      supply/demand mechanic that one would expect. This is
--      achieved by letting the prices be proportional to the in-
--      verse of the volumes.
--   2. But no matter what is bought/sold, the average price of
--      the four goods will (approximately) remain constant; if
--      one falls, the others will rise. This is achieved by nor-
--      malizing the volumes and then scaling them up to the
--      target value. This implements what was likely the design-
--      er's goal of encouraging the production and sale of all
--      four goods (or at least the more the better) by allowing
--      the prices to remain stable no matter how much is sold,
--      so long as multiple of the goods (the more, the better)
--      are sold. If the player only sells one, its price will
--      quickly drop and the others will rise. If the player
--      sells all four of them in alternation, none of the prices
--      will drop, no matter how much is sold. This way, if the
--      player can always rely on earning a lot of gold so long
--      as they are producing all four goods, and the prices will
--      never drop.
--
-- It seems like, ideally, step 3 (taking the inverse) would be
-- done before step 2 (normalizing), since presumably we want the
-- average *price* of the goods to remain approximately constant
-- and not their inverses (volumes) per se. But, that is what the
-- original game appears to do.
--
-- There are some additional technicalities, such as ignoring
-- negative values in some cases, and rounding/nan behavior, that
-- may not have reasons per se, but they are just what the orig-
-- inal game appears to do.
--
-- This function appears to reproduces the OG's numbers *exact-
-- ly*, despite the complex behaviors of the prices, and is thus
-- quite astonishing.

  -- The OG evolves the volumes each turn by multiplying the
  -- total volume (intrinsic + traded) by .99. That said, it
  -- never modifies the traded volumes, and so the evolution of
  -- total volume is only reflected in the intrinsic volume.
  -- Hence why we add in the traded volume, then multiply by .99,
  -- then remove it again.
  --
  -- Although the OG likely wanted to scale r down by 1%, it
  -- likely uses a fixed point representation with 8 decimal
  -- bits. In that representation, .9921875 is the closest one
  -- can get to .99.
  --
  -- The addition of .5 is needed to make the numbers match the
  -- empirical data exactly. Not sure if the OG explicitly does
  -- this or if it some kind of artifact of the way it does
  -- floating point math. One possibility is that adding this
  -- bias will prevent the intrinsic volumes from drifting all
  -- the way to zero, which would not be good because this model
  -- does not behave well when they hit zero.
