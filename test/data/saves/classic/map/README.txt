AMER2.MP is the map of "America" that shipped with the OG.

However, it seems to use a slightly different convention in some
cases for representing forested tiles.

If you load it into the map editor and then save it, it will be
saved with its "standard" convention, which we are able to parse
here. It is possible that the other convention was for an older
version of the game and the new game still supports it.

So AMER-NEW.MP represents this "fixed" format.
