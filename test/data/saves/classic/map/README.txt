AMER2.MP is the map of "America" that shipped with the OG.

However, it seems to use a slightly different convention in some
cases for representing forested tiles.

The actual game uses the one convention while the AMER2.MP map
uses the other. We support loading both formats since there is
never an ambiguity.

So AMER-NEW.MP represents the "new" format while AMER2.MP repre-
sents the old format (not sure where the "2" ever came from).
