# These are filled out when converting from NG -> OG so that if
# we want to convert back to NG (thereby performing a roundtrip)
# we can do so in a way that recovers the original IDs. This is
# only needed for doing roundtrip tests of the bridge conversion
# methods. Outside of testing, it is not necessary to track or
# preserve IDs when interconverting between the two formats.

  # NOTE: These ids go from OG -> NG.
