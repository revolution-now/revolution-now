// This associative queue, which is basically a list+map data
// structure that allows O(1) push, pop, and removal by value ap-
// pears to be noticeably faster than than using the alternatives
// (std::queue, std::set, set::unordered_set). This because we
// need to not only push/pop efficiently, but we need to be able
// to delete from the middle efficiently for when a coroutine
// gets destroyed.
//
// Because it is a kind of queue, it will ensure that coroutines
// get run in a FIFO manner. This does not actually seem neces-
// sary, since coroutines that are scheduled to run in the same
// frame are conceptually running asynchronously, and so should
// be tolerant of any (even non-deterministic) ordering. That
// said, the fact that we order them in a FIFO manner will guar-
// antee no starvation, just in case that ever becomes a concern
// (I don't believe that the code base currently has the kind of
// complex interaction among coroutines that would be necessary
// to make it a concern, but I don't know for sure).
