  # game window (though the two may coincide) in native pixels.

  # This is in physical coordinates because 1) that is how it is
  # most useful, and 2) it can't generally be expressed in dis-
  # creet logical coordinates anyway because it may start on a
  # fractional logical coordinate.

  # get, the better.
