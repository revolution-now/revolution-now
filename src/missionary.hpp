// Note: In the OG, if a native convert is not put to work within
// eight turns then the unit disappears. However, in this game we
// don't replicate that, since it seems that it was originally
// added to incentivize the player to use the native convert be-
// fore it was made stronger at outdoor jobs than free colonists.
// From the strategy guide:
//
//   "The eight-tum rule is a vestige ef an earlier version ef
//   the game in which Native Converts were not supen'or to Free
//   Colonists in wry capacity but retained the disadvantages
//   they possess now. In that version, it was sometimes diffi-
//   cult to find a use for Native Converts because Free
//   Colonists and other colonist types were usually equal or su-
//   penÂ·or to them. The bonusfor Native Convert production was a
//   late addition to the game, which now makes them attractive
//   colonists. It also increases the value efcreating Mission-
//   aries and establishing missions."
