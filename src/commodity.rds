  # enough visual space in a cargo slot to display the numerical
  # quantity, unlike the OG which did not and hence needed a
  # non-textual visual signal as to when a commodity was not at
  # full quantity in a cargo slot. But, it is nice to have the
  # additional visual indicator anyway, and it will be familiar
  # to players of the OG.
