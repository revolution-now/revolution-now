// the entire colony coroutine so that we don't have to propagate
// signals up the call stack manually. Note that when this is
// thrown, the colony object will still exist, just that it will
// have no colonists in it. So it should be ok if some code ref-
// erences the colony during the unwinding.

// This is thrown when we want to back out all the way to the top
// of the turn loop, perhaps due to some change in the configura-
// tion of the game.
