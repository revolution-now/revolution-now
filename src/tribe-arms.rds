  # In the OG the muskets readout does not appear to be stored
  # anywhere; instead it is computed as follows:
  #
  #   Muskets = 50*muskets
  #           + 50*armed_brave_count
  #           + 50*mounted_warrior_count
  #
  # Note that due to the probabilistic nature with which reserves
  # are depleted, this can cause total muskets to increase with
  # time, which might be a bit confusing to the player, since the
  # natives are not supposed to be able to produce their own mus-
  # kets. But, it is not clear how to report it otherwise. Even
  # if we separate the readouts for musket reserves from those
  # held by armed units, the reserves could still increase if
  # e.g. a brave is armed while not depleting reserves, then that
  # same brave is destroyed and the tribe retains the muskets.
  muskets 'int',

  # In the OG this is literally just horse_herds; does not in-
  # clude horse breeding numbers or horses held by braves.
  #
  # However, that number as such probably won't be very helpful
  # or meaningful to the player, so in the NG we do it a bit dif-
  # ferently in order to make it consistent with how muskets are
  # done:
  #
  #   Horses = 50*horse_herds
  #          + 50*floor( horse_breeding/25 )
  #          + 50*mounted_brave_count
  #          + 50*mounted_warrior_count
  #
  horses 'int',
