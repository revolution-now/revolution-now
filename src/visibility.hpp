** Visibility
*****************************************************************/
// This allows asking for the contents and visibility status of a
// map square in a generic way that works when rendering either a
// player-specific map or an all-visible map. Specifically, when
// asking for a map square, it will always yield a value, but it
// will prefer the player's version of the square if there is a
// player view and if the player has seen that square. Otherwise
// it will retrieve the real map square. That said, there is also
// a method for querying whether a tile is visible. Note that all
// methods in this class are total, because they will return
// proto squares for tiles that are off-map.
struct Visibility {
  static Visibility create( SSConst const&        ss,
                            base::maybe<e_nation> nation );

  // Returns if the tile is visible in this rendering. If the
  // tile if off-map then false is returned (proto square).
  bool visible( Coord tile ) const;

  // In general we're rendering the terrain from the point of
  // view of a player and so it may have only partial visibility.
  // Our square_at function thus will try the player's first,
  // then fall back to the real map. Even when rendering for a
  // plyaer we still need access to the real map in some cases
  // because to render a (visible) tile we need to know the ter-
  // rain type of the adjacent tiles to render the spill-over
  // part. If the tile is not on the map, it will return one of
  // the proto squares (which are always considered to be "visi-
  // ble" to the player).
  MapSquare const& square_at( Coord tile ) const;

  // For convenience.
  Rect rect_tiles() const;

  // Is the tile on the map.

// has visibility on the given tile. To qualify, the nation must
// be able to currently see the tile.

// This will look up the unit type's sighting radius, and then
// compute each (existing) square that the unit could see as-
// suming it is on the given tile, and will do so according to
// the OG's rules. This means that a land (sea) unit can see ALL
// squares in its immediate vicinity, plus all LAND (SEA) squares
// beyond that (and <= to its sighting radius). This looks a bit
// odd at first but is probably to prevent the ships with the ex-
// tended sighting radius from being able to reveal too many land
// tiles too easily, or a scout from being able to see on adja-
// cent islands (which would be easily possible after getting De
// Soto, in which case it would have 7x7 site).

// spective from which the land map should be rendered. It can be

// player (entire map), or current player. This is used at the
// start of each player's turn (if they are human) to set the map
// to their view, and is also used by the cheat function "reveal
// map." The default_nation is the nation that we will use if
// `revealed` is nothing; if default_nation in turn is nothing
// then it means "entire map."
