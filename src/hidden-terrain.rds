# When the user enters Hidden Terrain mode, the `hide` animation
# phase will gradually remove things until only the ground ter-
# rain (plus rivers/hills/mountains) remain. The `hold` animation
# is just rendered and held until the user hits a key, at which
# point the `show` animation gradually restores the view back to
# normal. This is meant to emulate the OG's behavior when enter-
# ing/leaving Hidden Terrain mode. Note that the user can hit a
# key during the animation phases to skip ahead to the next.
