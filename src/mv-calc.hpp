** MovementPointsAnalysis
*****************************************************************/
// Although a unit has a fixed number of movement points, there
// are exceptions made to this rule probably for a good player
// experience. In particular, in some cases the unit is allowed
// to use more points than it has.
//
//   1. A unit that hasn't yet moved at all needs to be able to
//      move onto any square even if they don't have enough move-
//      ment points. If this weren't the case then e.g. a free
//      colonist would never be able to move along most of the
//      map, since e.g. mountains and forest require more than
//      one movement point.
//   2. The original game will allow a unit to exceed their total
//      movement points with some degree of randomness. In par-
//      ticular, when a unit with N>0 movement points left at-
//      tempts to move onto a square requiring M>N movement
//      points (i.e., they don't have enough) then the unit will
//      be able to succeed in moving with probability N/M. For
//      example, if a free colonist moves one square along a
//      road, they will have 2/3 movement points left. At this
//      point, the game will allow them to move onto a square
//      that requires two movement points, but only with a proba-
//      bility of (2/3)/2=1/3.

  // How many points should actually be deducted from this unit

  // that case the unit forfeits its movement points.

  // move would proceed anyway, and the result was in the affir-
  // mative.

// Given a unit and an amount of movement points, this function

// some randomness (hence repeated identical calls to it can in
// general return different results). The analysis is based on
// the number of movement points that the unit has remaining as
// well as how many are needed.

// Note that the movement points passed into this function must
// be the final points required after considering e.g. colonies,
// roads, rivers, or ships on the square.
