// Take advantage of the fact that the get_return_object function
// on the promise is allowed to return a type that is implicitly
// convertible to the result. This type is non-copyable and non-
// movable, so should guarantee that the maybe<T> that it holds
// will be a singleton within the coroutine and will not move ad-
// dresses. This is then used to give the promise the address of
// its maybe<T> member so that the promise can fill it in.
// Without this, a co_return would not be able to communicate the
// result since the get_return_object is called at the start of
// the coroutine.
//
// Note this also requires that compiler defer the implicit con-
// version of the return object until the point of return. Some
// versions of MSVC may not do this (although they are supposed
// to in the future); if the implicit conversion is done eagerly
// what is done here is probably undefined behavior in that the
// maybe_holder would be immediately converted to a maybe and the
// pointer held by the promise would point into a dead object.
