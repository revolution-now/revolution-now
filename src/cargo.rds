# Here is an example of the way the cargo layout works:
#
# +------------------------------------------------------------+
# |         |         |         |         |         |          |
# |  Comm.  | UnitId  | Overfl. |  Empty  |  Empty  |  UnitId  |
# |         |         |         |         |         |          |
# +------------------------------------------------------------+
#      1        2         3          4         5         6
#
# That means that the first slot is occupied by a commodity, the
# second AND third slots are occupied by a single unit that takes
# up two slots, the fourth slot is empty, the fifth slot is
# empty, and the last slot is occupied by a unit (that takes one
# slot).
#
# NOTE: the `empty` state must be first in the list so that it it
# will be the default-constructed value.
