  # dered behind the landscape buffer. We can't put it in the
  # normal buffer since that will be rendered on top of the land-
  # scape buffer. But we may not want to put it in the landscape
  # buffer because it might need to be dynamic.

  # This is used to modify tiles in the landscape buffer by just

  entities,
  # For the overlays that signal both unexplored terrain and
  # fog-of-war (when enabled). The reason that the fog overlays
  # get put into a different buffer is so that we can draw the
  # entities (e.g. units) in between the landscape and fog lay-
  # ers.

# Describes a range of vertices and the buffer the are in. This
