# These should be in order of rendering.
enum.e_render_buffer {
  # The backdrop buffer can be used if something needs to be ren-
  # dered behind the landscape buffer. We can't put it in the
  # normal buffer since that will be rendered on top of the land-
  # scape buffer. But we may not want to put it in the landscape
  # buffer because it might need to be dynamic.
  backdrop,
  landscape,
  # This is used to modify tiles in the landscape buffer by just
  # overwriting them. This buffer will be drawn overtop of the
  # landscape buffer.
  landscape_annex,
  # For rendering pixelations of landscape tiles. The idea here
  # is that we draw a bunch of tiles to this buffer in the same
  # manner as we would to the normal landscape buffer, and then
  # we adjust a uniform each frame to enpixelate the buffer as a
  # whole, which creates the effect of a bunch of landscape tiles
  # pixelating to another state. Doing it this way means that we
  # don't have to redraw those landscape tiles each frame, so it
  # is scalable.
  landscape_anim,
  # For units, colonies, and dwellings.
  entities,
  # For the overlays that signal both unexplored terrain and
  # fog-of-war (when enabled). The reason that the fog overlays
  # get put into a different buffer is so that we can draw the
  # entities (e.g. units) in between the landscape and fog lay-
  # ers.
  obfuscation,
  obfuscation_annex,
  normal,
}

# Describes a range of vertices and the buffer the are in. This
# is used to record the location of the vertices corresponding to
# a map tile in case they need to be overwritten.
