# An `command` is a general term describing what the player
# proposes that a unit do when the unit asks the player. Roughly
# speaking, it captures the input that the player gives when the
# unit is waiting for commands. This could include "wait", "goto
# tile X", "move to tile X", "forfeight movement points", "plow
# square", "build colony". command only represent what the
# player has proposed, and so it makes sense to talk about com-
# mands that are not permitted. For example, the player might
# give commands to a unit to "move left", but doing so might
# cause a land unit to go into a sea square without a ship, which
# would not be allowed. In that case, the command is not allowed.
