  # for being fortified within a Stockade may be an error. When
  # questioned about this before publication, the designers said
  # that the fortified bonus would not apply to units inside for-
  # tifications, but it clearly does in the first released ver-
  # sion of Colonization for a unit fortified inside a Stockade.
  # In this case, the unit receives the same 150 percent bonus
  # that any unit receives inside a Fort. However, a unit inside
  # a Fort does not have to be fortified and the Fort has other
  # benefits as well. In future versions of Colonization, the
  # fortified bonus may not apply to units inside a Stockade."
