# Note that there is no "veteran" bonus here, unlike in the OG.
# That is because in this game we bake that (+50%) bonus into the
# unit's baseline combat value instead of treating it like a
# bonus. This is to make the combat calculation info more intu-
# itive throughout the game.

  # From the SG: "The Jact that units receive a 50 percent
  # bonusJor beingJortjfied within a Stockade may be an error.
  # When questioned about this before publication, the designers
  # said that thefartjfied bonus would not app{y to units inside-
  # Jortjfications, but it clear{y does in the first released
  # version qf ColonizationJor a unitJortj/led inside a Stockade.
  # In this case, the unit receives the same 150 percent bonus
  # that any unit receives inside a Fort. However, a unit inside
  # aJort does not have to beJortjfied and the Fort has other
  # benefits as well. Infature versions qf Colonization, the
  # Jortjfied bonus may not app{y to units inside a Stockade."
