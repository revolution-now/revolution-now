  # the colony itself as well as any outdoor workers in the
  # colony. The OG does this, probably because there wouldn't be
  # a clear way to prevent the player from using the land before
  # meeting the natives and no clear way to evict them after
  # they've founded a colony. Also, it enables an interesting
  # strategy where the player can attempt to found colonies ini-
  # tially while avoiding contact with the natives in order to
  # not have to pay for the first few land squares.
