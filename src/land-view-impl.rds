    # NOTE: this tile may be off of the map. This is ok since we
    # do allow it to be one tile off the left or right edge to
    # allow the player to send ships to the harbor. The reason we
    # represent such goto commands with a tile and not the dedi-
    # cated `harbor` mode is because with the latter then you
    # lose the player's desired path to get to the high seas, so
    # e.g. if the unit is on the left side of the map and the
    # player drags a ship off the right edge of the map, we don't
    # want the ship traveling to the left simply because that is
    # a shorter path to the high seas, given that the player ex-
    # plicitly chose the right side.
    curr_tile 'gfx::point',
    # This is used to suppress auto panning when initiating a
    # goto (in either keyboard or mouse mode) when the mouse is
    # initially at the edge of the screen upon entering goto
    # mode. If we don't do this then the player will likely be
    # met with a sudden unexpected panning of the screen. Instead
    # we require that the mouse be put away from the edges at
    # least once after entering goto mode before we allow auto
    # panning (meaning that we only allow auto panning when the
    # use purposely moves the mouse to the edge of the screen and
    # not just because the mouse happen to being at the edge of
    # the screen when entering goto mode).
