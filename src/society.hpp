// turns the society to which they belong. Note that, if there is
// a result, there is a unique result, since a single square can
// never be occupied by entities from different societies, even
// ones that are at peace. Note that when a missionary is working
// in a native dwelling the missionary is technically not owned
// by the map, so in that case this will always return the tribe
// of the native dwelling.
//
// NOTE: this is only to be used on squares that are clear to the
// current viewer since it does not take into account visibility.
