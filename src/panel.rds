  # This does not include the active unit, if there is one. When

  # units; it only contains the one visible on top. NOTE: these
  # will be sorted by the logic in the unit-stack module which
  # handles selecting the order of display when there are mul-
  # tiple units on a tile. We have to do it this way so that it
  # is consistent with what the player sees, especially in the
  # case where there are foreign units on a tile and we only want
  # the player to see the "top" one. NOTE: this ordering is not
  # the same as the unit ordering that controls ordering at the
  # colony gate or at the harbor.
  unit_stack 'std::vector<PanelUnit>',

  # This will always be true if there are multiple units on the
  # tile, even they are not all provided in the vector. This is
  # so that we can render a double flag so that it is consistent
  # with what the player would see on the map.
