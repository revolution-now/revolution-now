  # We need to manually update fog squares for a couple of rea-
  # sons:
  #
  #   1. The automatic updating of player squares that happens
  #      when a unit has its ownership changed (via the proper
  #      API) will only update the owning player's fog square,
  #      whereas here we want to update the human player's, be-
  #      cause they are being told of the update.
  #   2. There are cases where the fog square would not be up-
  #      dated even for the owning player, e.g. in the case of a
  #      missionary in a dwelling. We need to update the player
  #      square there so that the color of the missionary cross
  #      changes.
  #
  # These squares will only be updated if they are fogged.
