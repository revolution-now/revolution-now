  # This field only has a value if the unit is a ship and the
  # ship arrived in europe by sailing the high seas in the new
  # world. In that case it specifies the square from which the
  # unit sailed the high seas. This is so that, when the ship
  # eventually returns to the new world, it can be placed where
  # it left. Note that this square is not the destination square
  # of the last move order but the source square, since the des-
  # tination square might not exist if the unit moved off the
  # edge of the map.
  #
  # On the other hand if the ship ended up in europe without
  # having sailed there (possibly because it was purchased there
  # or it was damaged and was transported there) then this will
  # not have a value. In those cases, the game will place the
  # ship on the last sea lane square sailed by the player, re-
  # gardless of which side of the map it is on. If, in turn, that
  # value is not present (i.e. at the very start of the game)
  # then it will use the player's starting position as a final
  # fallback.
