# Note that this struct needs to maintain an invariant, namely
# that the derived unit type (`type`) can be reached starting
# from the base type (`base_type`) via some set of modifiers.
#
# The reason that it must store the base type and not just the
# final type is because the game rules allow units to lose modi-
# fiers in various ways, in which case a unit must "remember"
# what it's base type was. For example, when an indentured ser-
# vant (the base type) is made into a soldier (the final type)
# and that soldier loses a battle then the unit must be demoted
# back to an indentured servant (and not e.g. a free colonist)
# and so therefore when we store the type of a unit we must in-
# clude this base type.
