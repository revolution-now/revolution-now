# NOTE: the instantiation of this config object is in this module
# because, for normal usage by game code, this config structure
# should not be read directly but should be read via the engine
# interface because its values need to be read in from a file. It
# is hoped that putting it here will prevent normal game code
# from accidentally accessing it directly.
