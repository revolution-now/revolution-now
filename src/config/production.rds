  # In general the order in which these are applied matters be-
  # cause some of them are additive and some multiplicative. When
  # they are all additive, as in e.g. the case of farming in the
  # original game, the order does not matter. In the case of e.g.
  # cotton on prairie tiles, the original game appears to compute
  # in this order, where each is present:
  #
  #   1. base:        3
  #   2. resource:   x2

  #   production = ((3*2)+1+1)*2 = 16

  # tile is eligible for both plow and river bonuses, they can

  # taining a major river and minerals; in that case the fur pro-
  # duction would receive a river bonus of +4, putting it at
  # 3+4=7, whereas for ore it would be 1+3+2=6. By nurfing the
  # river bonus for fur we can prevent this.
