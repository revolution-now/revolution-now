# Unit promotion. Only base types can be promoted, but the de-
# rived type can sometimes inform how that happens. So both base
# types and derived types can have this attribute, but some al-
# ternatives are only allowed for one or the other.
sumtype.UnitPromotion {
  # For base types. The unit type always changes to a fixed type.
  fixed {
    type 'e_unit_type',
  },
  # For base types. The unit gains some expertise dictated by the
  # occupation that it is currently assuming.
  #
  # Examples:
  #
  #   * If a free colonist is planting cotton then it will be
  #     promoted to an expert cotton planter.
  #   * If a free colonist is studying carpentry then it will be-
  #     come a carpenter.
  #   * If a free colonist becomes a scout and wins a battle then
  #     it will be promoted to seasoned scout (not veteran sol-
  #     dier). So when a unit is assuming a derived type, the
  #     "occupation" is determined by the type of occupation of
  #     the derived type and not what the unit is immediately en-
  #     gaged in.
  #   * If a free colonist set as a pioneer wins a battle, it
  #     will become a hardy pioneer.
  #
  occupation {},
  # For derived types. The unit type provides expertise that will
  # be given to a base type if it has the `occupation` promotion
  # flag. If the base type has the `fixed` promotion flag then
  # that will be respected. If the base type has no promotion
  # flag then no promotion will happen. An example of the latter
  # is if an expert farmer is made into a scout and then experi-
  # ences a promotion event; in that case nothing will happen.
  expertise {
    kind 'e_unit_activity',

  # This one is allowed for either base types or derived types,
  # but in practice it is only used for derived types in the de-
  # fault game rules. A unit type with the `modifier` promotion
  # flag will gain the modifier upon promotion. For example, a
  # veteran dragoon that wins a battle after independence is de-
  # clared might be promoted to a continental cavalry. If the
  # base type cannot accept the modifier then no promotion hap-
  # pens.

  # ferred from the base type, which it kind of has to be because
  # in theory there could be multiple pathways to derive a single
  # unit and so there (again, theoretically) wouldn't be a
  # well-defined value for this field for a derived type. For a
  # base type, it can be either "yes" or "no".

  # no base type can have that inventory type, and 2) derived
