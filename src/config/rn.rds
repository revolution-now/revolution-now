  # willing to do a smooth scroll; beyond that point if will just
  # jump immediately. This is a multiplicative factor; basically
  # the real distance is divided by this factor before deter-
  # mining whether it is too far away, and so the larger it is,
  # the further the map is willing to smooth scroll. When this is
  # 1.0 then the threshold for scrolling will be roughly one
  # screen length, where screen length is defined as the average
  # of the two screen dimensions. This can be fractional.
