  # Weights (for the lowest difficulty level) for the given unit
  # types to appear on the docs as immigrants each time a new
  # unit is added to the pool. Note that the original game re-
  # stricts these units to human units, although that can be
  # changed if if desired. The probability of a unit appearing
  # will be its weight divided by the sum of all weights.

  # These factors adjust the weights for each difficulty level.
  # The weight for a given unit type is given by the base weight
  # multipled by pow(difficulty_factor, level) where level is in
  # [0,4]. Once these factors are multiplied onto the base
  # weights, then the probabilities are computed as usual.
  #
  # The benefit of making this a multiplicative factor instead of
  # an additive one is that they don't necessarily have to be re-
  # computed when the base weights are adjusted.

  # The formula that the OG appears to use to compute the cost of
  # a rushed recruitment is:
  #
  #   cost = max( ((T-X)/T)*(M+P*N)+B, I )
  #
  # where:
  #
  #   T: total crosses needed for immigrant.
  #   X: crosses accumulated since last immigrant.
  #   M: a difficulty dependent term.
  #   P: amount by which the starting price increases as a
  #      result of each additional rushed recruit.
  #   N: number of rushed recuits to date.
  #   B: fixed baseline cost.
  #   I: minimum cost.
