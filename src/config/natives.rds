  # After all of the production-based weights are computed the

  # cause it is not derived from production. So the a scouting

  # the sum of all weights, F is the fraction ([0,1]) of sur-
  # rounding tiles that are forested (since the OG seems to only

  # forested tiles) and S is the below scale factor that will
  # normally be larger than one.

struct.LandPrices {
  # The price demanded by a native tribe for a tile is computed
  # as follows.
  #
  # * There is a base price that is computed based on tribe
  #   level, difficulty level, and the number of colonies that
  #   the player has:
  #
  #     base price = B + floor(C/2)*IC + L*IL + D*ID
  #
  #   where:
  #
  #     B:  anchor price, 65 in OG.
  #     IC: increment per two colonies, 32.5 in OG.
  #     C:  min( #colonies of player, MC ).
  #     MC: Number of colonies beyond which the base price no
  #         longer increases with additional colonies. 6 in OG.
  #     IL: increment per tribe level, 32.5 in OG.
  #     L:  tribe level, starting at zero (nomadic, agrarian,
  #         aztec, inca).
  #     ID: increment per difficulty level, 65 in OG.
  #     D:  difficulty level, starting at zero.
  #
  # Then there are a series of multiplicative modifiers:
  #
  # * When a square has a prime resource on it. There do not seem
  #   to be any other modifiers having to do with terrain type.
  # * When the dwelling owning the tile is a capital.
  # * The price increases the angrier the tribe. Through this
  #   mechanism, the price can increase all the way up to 4x. The
  #   tribal anger multiplier is (1+n), where n is an integer
  #   that increases as the tribal anger increases and goes from
  #   [0,4]. The dwelling anger does not seem to affect this.
  # * When the tile is not adjacent to the dwelling. The "dis-
  #   tance" to the tile in question is not the pythagorean dis-
  #   tance, but the square around the dwelling in which the tile
  #   lives. So immediately adjacent would be m=0, the square
  #   around that (5x5) would be m=1, etc.

  # B above. Anchor price. As can be seen from the base price
  # formula, this is the base price of a tile for a semi-nomadic
  # tribe on the discoverer difficulty level when the player has
  # no colonies. 65 in OG.
  anchor_price 'double',

  # IC above. 32.5 in OG.
  increment_per_two_colonies 'double',

  # MC above. 6 in OG.
  max_colonies_for_increase 'int',

  # IL above. 32.5 in OG.
  increment_per_tribe_level 'double',

  # ID above. 65 in OG.
  increment_per_difficulty_level 'double',

  # Multiplicative bonus applied when the tile has a prime re-
  # source on it.  2.0 in OG.
  bonus_prime_resource 'double',

  # Multiplicative bonus applied when dwelling that owns the tile
  # is a capital. 1.5 in OG.
  bonus_capital 'double',

  # The tribal anger multiplier is given by (1+n), where n goes
  # from zero up to this value inclusive. 3 in OG.

  # The multiplier is .9^m, where m=0 for adjacent squares, m=1
  # for outter square, and m=2 for outter corner squares and be-
