# NOTE: there is no config object instantiation in this module
# because, for normal usage by game code, this config structure
# should not be read directly but should be read via the engine
# interface because its values need to be read in from a file.
# There is a config instantiation of this (which holds the de-
# faults) but that is in a separate module in order to prevent
# normal game code from accidentally accessing it.
