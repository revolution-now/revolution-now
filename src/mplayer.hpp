// It is important to note when using this class that, in gen-
// eral, calling the member functions may not cause instantaneous
// change to the real underlying music player for which this
// class is a facade. This is because some music players run in
// other threads and so these interface methods may simply add
// commands into a queue to be consumed asynchronously by the
// music-playing thread. Hence, change may not take effect imme-
// diately and in some cases operations may happen out of order.
//
// To help with this there is a method called `fence`. Calling it
// will cause the calling thread to block until all previous com-
// mands sent to the music player have been processed. It also
// accepts a timeout to avoid hanging if something goes wrong.

  // that can be read by this player and that the file can be

  // file).

  // Start playing the given tune from the beginning. When the
  // tune finishes it stops playing until it is given another

  // -- Synchronization ---------------------------------------
  // To help ensure that operations on the music player are
  // well-ordered one calls `fence` before an operation that must
  // wait until previous operations have completed before run-
  // ning. Calling it will cause the calling thread to block
  // until all previous commands sent to the music player have
  // been processed.
  //
  // It also accepts a timeout to avoid hanging if something goes
  // wrong. If a timeout occurs then the function returns false,
  // otherwise true.
  virtual bool fence( maybe<Duration_t> timeout = nothing );

  // This one is a more passive aid in making sure that music
  // player commands are well-ordered. It simply returns true the
  // music player is still processing previous commands. It is
  // guaranteed safe to send new commands to the music player re-
  // gardless of whether it is processing or not, but one will
  // might want to call this to aid in e.g. disabling GUI ele-
  // ments while waiting for the music player to enact the last
  // command.
  virtual bool is_processing() const;

  // -- Optional Extensions -----------------------------------
  // The functions below may or may not be supported by a given
  // music player. If called on a player that doesn't support
  // them they will throw an exception on a debug build and just
  // log an error on a release build.

  // Pause playing of current tune. No-op if no tune is playing
  // or most recent tune has finished.
  virtual void pause();

  // Resume playing of paused tune. No-op if no tune is playing
  // or if most recent tune has finished.
  virtual void resume();

  // Get/Set current volume [0, 1.0].
  virtual void set_volume( double volume );

  // Seek to given position in current tune. position in [0,1].
  virtual void seek( double position );

** Silent Music Player
*
* This is a no-op music player for those cases where we want to
* have an active music player (that behaves as a real one) but we
* don't want any music playing. This is probably mostly for test-
* ing.
*
* This music player has the ability to simulate the playing of a
* tune, including duration/progress, and also has the ability to
* simulate failures to test overall error handling of the code
* that manages music players.
