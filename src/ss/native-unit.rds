# As in the OG, a native unit is always assumed to be 1) on the
# map, and 2) owned by a single dwelling. For that reason, the
# tribe of the unit is not a field in this struct because it can
# be inferred from the associated dwelling, and the associated
# dwelling is stored in the unit ownership struct.
