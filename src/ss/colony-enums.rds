# In this list we don't have silver, because in the original
# game, silver can only be mined on mountains, and colonies
# cannot be founded on mountains. Actually, in the version of the
# game used for measuring production stats, it is the case that
# in non-resource mountain tiles a non-expert (which is what we
# use to compute secondary job production) yields no silver; a
# non-expert can only yield silver from a mountain tile with a
# silver resource. But even if we were to support configuring the
# game to allow colonies to be founded on mountain tiles, there
# would be two issues. First, the silver resource (which is re-
# quired, as mentioned above) is the one resource in the game
# that can get depleted and eventually disappears (at which point
# the secondary job would revert to ore), which might be con-
# fusing for the player since the resource icon would not be vis-
# ible under the colony (or in "hidden terrain" mode). Second,
# the algorithm for choosing the secondary job would likely not
# choose silver anyway because there'd be more ore produced.
#
# Also, just as in the original game, we don't have lumber. The
# reason for this might have just been for game balancing.
