  # pean powers after declaration: they completely stop evolving,
  # but their colonies are still present on the map. Note that
  # the OG refers to this state as "withdrawn", but we're using a
  # different name here because "withdrawn" arguably is not the
  # ideal word, since such a player still retains their colonies;
  # it's really just that they no longer move or evolve.
