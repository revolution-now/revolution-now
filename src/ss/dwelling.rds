  # According to the manual there is both tribe-level anger and
  # dwelling-level anger (alarm). According to the manual:
  # "Overall tribal anger is affected by direct action you take
  # against the Indians. Alarm in individual settlements is af-
  # fected not by direct action, but by indirect pressures such
  # as your proximity to that settlement, the size of your
  # colony, the presence of weapons, and so on."
  #
  # This number is in [0, 99], with 99 being most alarmed. The
  # effective alarm of a dwelling must take into account both
  # this number and the tribal level anger.

  # TODO: The manual seems to mention that there is an alarm
  # level called "happy" that is superior to "content"; in that
  # case, we might want to start this off as non-zero.

  # This is so that the player can't keep meeting with the chief
  # and receiving gifts. After having met with the chief once,
  # scouts can continue to meet with the chief, but they won't
  # receive any gifts, even if the first encounter resulted in
  # nothing. But note that a scout is always "eligible" for being
  # used for "target practice" and eliminated, even if the chief
  # has already been spoken with. So in other words, this flag
  # only prevents the player from receiving multiple gifts from
  # the same chief.
