  # According to the manual there is both tribe-level anger and
  # dwelling-level anger (alarm). According to the manual:
  # "Overall tribal anger is affected by direct action you take
  # against the Indians. Alarm in individual settlements is af-
  # fected not by direct action, but by indirect pressures such
  # as your proximity to that settlement, the size of your
  # colony, the presence of weapons, and so on."
  #
  # This number is in [0, 99], with 99 being most alarmed. The
  # effective alarm of a dwelling must take into account both
  # this number and the tribal level anger.
  #
  # TODO: The manual seems to mention that there is an alarm
  # level called "happy" that is superior to "content"; in that
  # case, we might want to start this off as non-zero.

  # This is so that the player can't keep meeting with the chief
  # and receiving gifts. After having met with the chief once,
  # scouts can continue to meet with the chief, but they won't
  # receive any gifts, even if the first encounter resulted in
  # nothing. But note that a scout is always "eligible" for being
  # used for "target practice" and eliminated, even if the chief
  # has already been spoken with. So in other words, this flag
  # only prevents the player from receiving multiple gifts from
  # the same chief.

  # When there is a mission in a dwelling then that dwelling may
  # send native converts to the player. There are a couple of
  # ways that native converts can be produced (over time as the
  # missionary works, or when attacking a dwelling with a mis-
  # sion). Either way, when a convert gets "produced," it doesn't
  # actually create the unit immediately; instead it just sets
  # this value. Then, once each turn, this number will be checked
  # and, if the brave from this dwelling is adjacent to a play-
  # er's colony then a convert will be produced. The OG does not
  # seem to accumulate these, hence it is a bool instead of an
  # int. This also automatically enforces the OG's rule that only
  # one convert per turn is produced per dwelling (we can have
  # multiple per turn from different dwellings).
  #
  # We need to store this at the dwelling level (as opposed to
  # the tribe level) for two reasons. First, we need to know
  # which dwelling the convert is coming from so that it can be
  # delivered to a nearby colony. And second, if the dwelling
  # gets burned in a series of attacks that e.g. happen all in
  # one turn, then the ready convert inside should disappear (un-
  # less they emerge as a result of the attack, which can some-
  # times happen).

# The fields in the dwelling object are those that aren't involve
# in any form of ownership over the dwelling (e.g., no map loca-
# tion and no tribe ownership). With the exception of `id`, they
# are the quantities that can be safely changed after the
# dwelling has been created (though not all of them will be in
# practice due to game rules).
