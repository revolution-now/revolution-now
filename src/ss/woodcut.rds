# Records when a one-time event happens, e.g. "discovery of the
# pacific ocean." so that the associated actions are only per-
# formed once in the game. In the OG these events are accompanied
# be a screen-filling image of the event that gets enpixelated.
# These are inspired from the list of events in the OG's WOOD-
# CUT.TXT.

  # status with the tribe since then if that particular tribe is
  # wiped out then it will be erased.
