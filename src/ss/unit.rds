  # the benefits of fortification until the next turn. That way
  # you can't just immediately fortify when an enemy approaches
  # and gain the benefits. This is visually indicated on the flag
  # by rendering a dimmer 'F' after the fortification has gone
  # into effect. A unit will remain in the `fortifying` stage
  # until the next turn.

  # The values in this trade_route orders actually do not neces-
  # sarily need to be valid, because it is possible that the
  # player could edit or delete a trade route that is being car-
  # ried out by a unit and then save the game before the unit
  # moves and has a chance to react. It would be possible to
  # search through all units and edit their orders in response,
  # but it is probably better not to try to get that right and to
  # just let the unit react when it next moves.
  #
  # Note that these two fields correspond exactly to the low and
  # high nibbles (respectively) of the unit's auxiliary_data
  # field in the OG save file, except that the trade route ID
  # will have to be mapped to one of the available 0-12 there.
