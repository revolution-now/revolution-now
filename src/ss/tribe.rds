  # dwelling-level anger (alarm). According to the manual:
  # "Overall tribal anger is affected by direct action you take
  # against the Indians. Alarm in individual settlements is af-
  # fected not by direct action, but by indirect pressures such
  # as your proximity to that settlement, the size of your
  # colony, the presence of weapons, and so on."

  # This number is in [0, 99], with 99 being most alarmed. That
  # said, each tribe is configured to have a minimum tribal
  # alarm which this number will not go below.
  #
  # The effective alarm of a dwelling must take into account both
  # this number and the dwelling-level alarm.

  # TODO: The manual seems to mention that there is an alarm
  # level called "happy" that is superior to "content"; in that
  # case, we might want to start this off as non-zero.
