  # observed to be set by the OG in response to the cheat func-
  # tion "advance revolution status". Even when the war is won
  # normally and the REF forfeights, this flag does not appear to
  # get set. So it is possible it exists only to facilitate cheat
  # mode. For that purpose it is also useful for us.
