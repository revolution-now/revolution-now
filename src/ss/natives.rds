  # All players see the same native land ownership in the sense
  # that if one player takes a square from the natives it will
  # appear unowned from then on to all nations. The exception to
  # this is the acquisition of Peter Minuit; he will cause all
  # land to appear non-owned but only from the perspective of
  # that player. Therefore, acquiring Peter Minuit will not actu-
  # ally change this owned-land field. Therefore, this field
  # should not be read directly by normal code; instead one
  # should use the API functions in the native-owned module.
