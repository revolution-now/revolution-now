  # Player clicked on a colony. It is important that this be a
  # command sent back to the caller of the land-view module (as
  # opposed to the land-view input processor coroutine just
  # showing the colony window itself) because it is possible that
  # a user might change the orders of a unit in the colony view,
  # e.g. they could fortify the unit that is currently asking for
  # orders, then upon closing the colony view we'd be a bad state
  # (a fortified unit asking for orders). But by sending this
  # back to the turn processor, it can handle that issue and we
  # don't have that problem.

  # suming that they have not used their turn. This needs to be a
  # vector so that if there are multiple, then they can all be
  # prioritized before the first of them starts asking for or-
  # ders.
