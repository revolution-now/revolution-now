# These are the possible reactions that a tribe can have when es-
# tablishing a mission. In the OG this doesn't seem to affect
# anything (e.g., does not prevent the missionary from estab-
# lishing the mission); it just seems to be for the purpose of
# conveying the tribe's current alarm level to the player.

  # "The ... approach the new religion with curiosity." Note that
  # this was famously mispelled as "curiousity" in the OG.
