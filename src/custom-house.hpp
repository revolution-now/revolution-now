// TODO: for custom house:
//
//  +1.  Requires Stuyvesant; once obtained, any colony can build
//       the building at any time.
//  +2.  Can click on the building and select which goods should
//       be sold.
//  +3.  When a good reaches a quantity > 100 in a colony then
//       all but 50 of it is sold.
//  +4.  It sells goods before spoilage is assessed.
//  +5.  It cannot sell goods that are boycotted.  The custom
//       house in the OG seems to ignore boycotts, but this is
//       probably a bug, since the strategy guide does not men-
//       tion boycott-resistance as being among the abilities of
//       the custom house (FreeCol suggests its a bug). So in
//       this game this is a config flag that controls it, that
//       defaults to making the custom house respect boycotts.
//  +6.  Prior to the war of independence, custom house sales are
//       taxed according to the current tax rate, and there is no
//       further charge.
//  +7.  The custom house can trade with europe even after the
//       war of independence. There is supposed to be a 50%
//       charge for smuggling in that case, though it does not
//       appear to be applied in the OG, and the strategy guide
//       says that "it does not work in the first released ver-
//       sion of the game." We will apply it in this game though.
//   8.  If there is an enemy war ship within a couple of tiles
//       then the custom house is considered to be blockaded and
//       does not function.
//   9.  Even inland colonies can have custom houses, and those
//       cannot be blockaded. Though even colonies bordering
//       water without ocean access are considered inland (this
//       should be checked).
//  +10. Custom house sales still cause market prices to move,
//       but they can still only move one unit per turn.

// Allows the user to adjust which commodities are being sold by
// the custom house.
