# This specifies whether or not we want to allow an immediate
# price change as a result of a transaction. In most cases in the
# game we do, but for the custom house transactions we don't (be-
# cause we want all colonies' transactions to finish first before
# price bumps are computed because the game rules dictate that we
# can only have a price movement of +/-1 per turn). This needs to
# be specified when computing the transaction because in some
# cases (i.e., for default model goods) the intrinsic volume com-
# putation is adjusted if there is an immediate price bump.
