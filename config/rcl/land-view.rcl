# When the player is moving a unit and it runs out of movement
# points there is a chance that the player will accidentally
# issue a couple of extra input commands to the unit beyond the
# end of its turn. If that happens then the very next unit to ask
# for orders would get those commands and move in a way that the
# player likely had not intended. So we have a mechanism for pre-
# venting that whereby there is a small grace period after the
# start of the new unit's turn where any input commands are
# thrown out, and this configures the associated parameters. Vi-
# sually, there will be an hourglass indicator temporarily drawn
# on the new unit let the player know that a few input commands
# were thrown out.

  # This is the maximum number of relevant key presses (basically
