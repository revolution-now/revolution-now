# Weights (for the lowest difficulty level) for the given unit
# types to appear on the docs as immigrants each time a new unit
# is added to the pool. Note that the original game restricts
# these units to human units, although that can be changed if if
# desired. The probability of a unit appearing will be its weight
# divided by the sum of all weights.

# Note that when William Brewster is obtained, probabilities are
# then computed by first zeroing out the criminal and servant
# weights, then proceeding as usual.

# These factors adjust the weights for each difficulty level. The

# pled by pow(difficulty_factor, level) where level is in [0,4].

# The benefit of making this a multiplicative factor instead of
# an additive one is that they don't necessarily have to be re-
# computed when the base weights are adjusted.
