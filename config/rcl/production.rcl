      # The available documentation on the classic game states
      # the following for the forumla for silver:
      #
      #   base: 1, road/river: +1, resource: +2, expert: x2
      #
      # which implies that a free colonist should produce at
      # least one unit. However, in the version of the game from
      # which these numbers were taken, the actual behavior is
      # not only different from this, but it seems to depart from
      # all other commodities. Specifically, when a tile has ei-
      # ther a silver resource or minerals resource then it will
      # follow the above formula; but when it has no resource
      # then a free colonist produces zero, while an expert pro-
      # duces one, but only on mountain tiles.
      #
      # Furthermore, those numbers (for non-resource tiles)
      # strangely don't seem to get subject to the usual bonuses;
      # neither Sons of Liberty bonuses nor road/river bonuses
      # seem to get applied, which suggests that they might have
      # been hard-coded. On the other hand, when there is a
      # silver resource, the above numbers hold and are computed
      # in the usual way as with other commodities, and are sub-
      # ject to Sons of Liberty bonuses.
      #
      # Also found in this version of the game is an (again un-
      # documented) "depleted" silver resource, which appears to
      # follow the following numbers:
      #
      #   base: 1, road/river: +1, resource: 0, expert: x2
      #
      # i.e., it provides a zero resource bonus. That seems
      # strange, but given that silver production is almost com-
      # pletely suppressed without any silver resources, the
      # above does yield a bonus overall just by virtue of en-
      # abling silver mining.
      #
      # Perhaps the game designers wanted to nurf silver produc-
      # tion at the last minute and made some changes, including
      # hard-coding reduced numbers for non-resource tiles.
