#   has:
#
#     base price = B + floor(C/2)*IC + L*IL + D*ID + P*IP
#
#   where:
#
#     B:  anchor price, 65 in OG.
#     IC: increment per two colonies, 32.5 in OG.
#     C:  min( #colonies of player, MC ).
#     MC: Number of colonies beyond which the base price no
#         longer increases with additional colonies. 6 in OG.
#     IL: increment per tribe level, 32.5 in OG.
#     L:  tribe level, starting at zero (nomadic, agrarian,
#         aztec, inca).
#     ID: increment per difficulty level, 65 in OG.
#     D:  difficulty level, starting at zero.
#     IP: increment per land square already acquired from
#         this tribe via payment. 32.5 in OG.
#     P:  number of land squares acquired from this tribe
#         via payment.
#
# Then there are a series of multiplicative modifiers:
#
# * When a square has a prime resource on it. There do not seem
#   to be any other modifiers having to do with terrain type.
# * When the dwelling owning the tile is a capital.
# * The price increases the angrier the tribe. Through this mech-
#   anism, the price can increase all the way up to 4x. The
#   tribal anger multiplier is (1+n), where n is an integer that
#   increases as the tribal anger increases and goes from [0,4].
#   The dwelling anger does not seem to affect this.
# * When the tile is not adjacent to the dwelling. The "distance"
#   to the tile in question is not the pythagorean distance, but
#   the square around the dwelling in which the tile lives. So
#   immediately adjacent would be m=0, the square around that
#   (5x5) would be m=1, etc.
