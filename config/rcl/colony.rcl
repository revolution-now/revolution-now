# ways manifest as precisely one unit reduction in production,

# multipliers are applied. Also, note that in the original game,

# non-experts (1 and 2). Note that, for indoor jobs, these
# bonuses will not always manifest as precisely that increase in
# production, since e.g. for indoor workers it is added before
# other multipliers are applied. The original game seems to make
# a few exceptions to the outdoor bonuses; namely the center
# square only gets 1/2, and lumberjacks seemingly have the bonus
# applied in a different order. In this game, for simplicity, we
# will apply these equally to all squares and all occupations,

  # If the given unit type can be auto-promoted via on-the-job
  # training then this will give the probability, which is ap-
  # plied independently to every unit every turn.
  #
  # These probabilities are difficult to measure in the original
  # game because 1) they are small, and 2) the original game's
  # random number generator is very bad. So these are taken from
  # the strategy guide. They make sense at least relative to each
  # other, since the on-the-job promotion takes any unit directly
  # to an expert, so e.g. it makes sense that a petty criminal
  # has 1/3 the probability for this transition as a free
  # colonist, because a petty criminal conceptually passes
  # through three states in order to get there (first to an in-
  # dentured servant, then to a free colonist, then to an ex-
  # pert).
  #
  # The strategy guide's verbiage seems to indicate that these
  # probabilities are applied to each colonist (in each colony)
  # independently on each turn (which is how this game does it),
  # but that is difficult to verify due to the low probabilities.
