# ---------------------------------------------------------------
# Template of Defaults for User Settings File.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------
# These are the default values for the per-user game configs.
# When the game is played for the first time it will create a
# user settings file in the game's folder using the values in
# this file as a template. From then on, this file is no longer
# consulted or changed; only the user settings file is read from
# and written to (when the user changes the settings).
#
# If one deletes the user settings file then it will be regener-
# ated on the next run of the game, again using the values in
# this file as defaults.
#
# NOTE: Changing the values in this file is generally not what
# you want to do; you should either change the settings in-game
# or you should locate the user settings file and change them
# there; this file just provides defaults and documentation.

  # This controls the specific framebuffer workflow that the ren-
  # derer uses to produce the final image on the screen. Possible
  # values:
  #
  #  direct_to_screen:
  #
  #    No post processing.
  #
  #  offscreen_with_logical_resolution:
  #
  #    Renders first to an offscreen texture whose size is equal
  #    to that current logical resolution. This has the effects
  #    of 1) enabling post processing, and 2) enforcing strict
  #    pixel sizes over the entire screen.
  #
  # The value offscreen_with_logical_resolution is chosen as the
  # default value because of two reasons: 1) it improves ren-
  # dering performance by reducing load on the fragment shader,
  # and 2) it helps to maintain a consistent pixelated aesthetic.
