# ===============================================================
# Founding Fathers
# ===============================================================
# Each father has a weight (determines the probability of appear-
# ance) for a given century, and these numbers are taken from the
# OG's NAMES.TXT file.
#
# That file also mentions that a "Father of higher level will not
# appear until at least one father of next lower level (of same
# type) has joined the Congress", but that does not seem to be
# the case when testing with the OG; all that seems to matter are
# the per-century weights.

  # The original games that De Soto will give all units an ex-
  # tended sighting radius. The meaning of this apparently is
  # that it takes the sighting radius of each unit and adds one
  # to it (even if it was already 2), since that is what it does
  # for land units. However, it does not do this for ships at
  # all. In this game do default to giving the bonus to ships in
  # order to make De Soto a bit more useful, but that can be
  # safely turned off here if the OG's behavior is desired.
