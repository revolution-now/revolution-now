type {
  # strength:
  #
  #   General strength of the missionary relative to one created
  #   by a free colonist. Note: the OG, despite claims from the
  #   OST, does not seem to distinguish the non-expert levels in
  #   missionaries (criminal, servant, and colonist), since it
  #   does not store it in its data model. However, it does dif-
  #   ferentiate between expert/non-expert. See the Differences
  #   doc for more details about this.
  #
  # per_turn_convert.probability:
  #
  #   When a dwelling contains a mission, each turn there is a
  #   probability that a convert will be produced. However, these
  #   are tricky to measure, since the frequency of actually re-
  #   ceiving a produced convert may depend on the "random walk"
  #   behavior of the braves and other factors, since 1) it seems
  #   that a convert is only delivered when the brave becomes ad-
  #   jacent to the colony, 2) it is not clear that a ready con-
  #   vert will always be delivered even by a brave that is adja-
  #   cent to a colony since e.g. it may decide to deliver a
  #   gift, and 3) is not delivered directly from the dwelling
  #   square to an adjacent colony; i.e., the brave has to leave
  #   the colony, do a random walk, end up near a colony, then
  #   provide the convert. TODO: the values of this parameter
  #   have been roughly estimated below, but once the brave
  #   random walking is in place then these need to be recali-
  #   brated. Initial measurements revealed that the value for
  #   the petty criminal missionary was higher than that of the
  #   servant or free colonist missionary, which is incorrect;
  #   the reason for that could potentially be that the random
  #   walking behavior of the braves needed to be taking into ac-
  #   count, though not sure about that.
  #
  # convert_on_attack.probability:
  #
  #   When attacking a dwelling containing a mission, this is the
  #   probability (on each attack) that an additional native con-
  #   vert will be produced.
