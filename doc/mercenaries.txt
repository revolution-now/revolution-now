TODO:

  * At the start of the turn (after all units have moved, but be-
    fore the turn ends) a message is shown like "The King of
    Spain offers to send us a force of trained [mercenaries] (3
    regular, artillery) in exchange for 8000 gold."
  * It may appear to happen at the end of the turn, but that is
    because the season/year doesn't appear to get updated until
    the player moves; instead it should be judged based on how
    the natives move.
  * Default selection is "No thank you."
  * If "yes" is selected then those units arrive immediately
    after the window closes. A message box says "Spanish merce-
    naries arrive in Jamestown."
  * They arrive by selecting a colony, then a Man-o-War with the
    player's flag (i.e. not the Spanish in this case, but the
    English) appears next to the colony and provides those
    forces.
  * There is some randomness in when it appears.
  * It happens:
      - Before declaration: ?
      - After declaration:  yes
  * If the player has no coastal colonies then we will simply not
    ask the player as there is no way for them to be delivered
    (not clear on what the OG does here, but either way we are
    kind of forced to do that).
  * When does it happen:
      * The frequency of the messages doesn't seem to depend on
        how many armies we have, although it might to a limited
        extent that is difficult to measure.
      * Seems to depend on quantity of money. One hypothesis is
        that the game rolls dice to see if it happens, then se-
        lects the units, then based on that (plus difficulty
        level) computes the price (note there is some randomness
        in the price as well, since the same set of units can
        cost different amounts), then if the player has enough it
        will ask them, otherwise no. TBD if this is correct.
  * When the player is given 100k+ gold from 1492, the earliest
    the message box has been seen to appear is in the year 1527
    (or could have been 1528). This seems to coincide with the
    first year that tax increase are allowed (1528 on conquista-
    dor). NOTE: the OG probably uses the turn count for this and
    not the actual year. That said, it is hard to measure pre de-
    claration because it is so rare.
  * They seem to happen much less often before declaration, at
    least during peace time.
  * Doesn't seem to be affected by peace/war status with other
    nations, though not yet sure if it monitors active combat.
  * It may happen more often when we are in active combat.
  * Minimum amount of money (on Conquistador) for this to happen
    seems to be 4000, although there really may not be a minimum.
    It could be that the units are chosen then cost computed and
    if the player has enough the the message will show.
  * Prices:
      * Asking price does not seem to scale with available money.
  * Some sample data on Conquistador (repeats not shown):
      - Pre declaration (uses normal units):
          2 dragoons              -> 3200
          1 dragoons, 1 artillery -> 4800
          4 dragoons              -> 6000
          2 dragoons, 1 artillery -> 6400
      - Post declaration (uses upgraded units):
          2 regulars, 1 artillery -> 4000, 4400, 4800, 5200, 5600, 6000, 6400
          2 regulars, 1 cavalry   -> 4000, 4400, 4800, 5200, 5600, 6000, 6400
          3 regulars, 1 artillery -> 5000, 5500, 6000, 6500, 7000, 7500, 8000
          3 regulars, 1 cavalry   -> 5000, 5500, 6000, 6500, 7000, 7500, 8000
