These do or may provide unique info beyond the primary source above:

  1. https://github.com/eb4x/viceroy
       Notes:
          * See savegame.h, looks like it has additional fields.
          * Forked: https://github.com/hegemogy/viceroy but looks behind.

  2. https://github.com/nawagers/Colonization-SAV-files/blob/master/Format.md
       Notes:
          * May have a couple bits of additional fields related to market prices.

       Notes:
          * The usefulness of this is that it provides additional links.

       Notes:
          * Has a lot of fields populated in reader.py, but not
            yet sure if there are any unique ones.
          * Forked from https://github.com/marfsama/colsaves but
            which appears to be behind.

Problems with fields
===========================================

  * water_color_cycling off when should be on (the field does
    change, just that it seems to be flipped. Probably not an is-
    sue, though we may want to change the name of that field to
    "water color cycling off").
  * colony_report_options.
  * The tuts are not filled out.
  * active_unit may be signed since when there are no active
    units it seems to be 65535. This looks like it also applies
    to the colony of origin and dwelling of origin fields, which
    can be 255.
  * change founding_fathers to a bit struct so that they are
    named.
  * unknown35 has something to do with colony count (along with
    the fields above/below it apparently).
  * relation_type seems to have an additional value even in new
    saves (64).

TODO
========================================================

  1. Add CLI flags to game for doing the conversions; include
     commands for working with map files only.
  2. Save/Load map only. This is needed because we want to be
     able to load the OG's map files, which contain only map
     data.
  3. Solve problem of how to obtain/represent the save-game sum-
     maries for each format.
  4. Go through other sources (web sites) with field mappings and
     try to fill in some of the missing ones.
  5. Try to map remaining fields.
  6. Add conversion between new and old.
  7. Add UI mechanism for working with OG sav files.
