       Notes:
          * See savegame.h, looks like it has additional fields.
          * Forked: https://github.com/hegemogy/viceroy but looks behind.

          * The usefulness of this is that it provides additional links.

       Notes:
          * Has a lot of fields populated in reader.py, but not
            yet sure if there are any unique ones.
          * Forked from https://github.com/marfsama/colsaves but
            which appears to be behind.
