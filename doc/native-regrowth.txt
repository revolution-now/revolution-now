Population increase and decrease in native dwellings
====================================================

  * There is a counter that increases by the current population
    amount each turn. This way, the population increases more
    slowly the lower the population. When it hits 20 then a new
    brave is created on the map. If a brave already exists on the
    map then the population is increased by one. If the popula-
    tion is already at the max, then the counter does not in-
    crease. This behavior does not seem to vary based on diffi-
    culty level or capital status. If the counter is incremented
    and it goes above 20, it is still reset to 0. The counter is
    a signed int, because you can set it to e.g. -30 and it will
    count up from -30 to +20 before increasing population.

  * When disbanding a free brave, it does not affect the popula-
    tion of the dwelling. Neither does killing one via combat.
