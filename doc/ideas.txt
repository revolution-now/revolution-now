Sound:

  - libADLMIDI (or in the future they may change its name to li-
    bOPLMIDI) is a midi player that generates sounds using an em-
    bedded OPL3 emulator. This would be ideal, but the MIDI->OPL3
    conversion code is currently GPL. Work is in progress to get
    it to LGPL, and when that happens it should be incorporated
    into rn.

Alternate gameplay modes:

  - When the player first makes land fall their ship sinks; they
    must gain wealth initially by traiding with the indians, then
    they can build ships to take them back to the old world.

Art:

  - Consider having the shader be able to adjust the overall
    saturation of the screen, and use it for some effects:
      - Flashing color/grey as an animation for something.
      - Colors get slightly more saturated on the map as
        rebel sentiment rises and falls throughout the game.
UI:

  - Panel can be opened/closed with a sliding animation.

Core Libraries:

  - Need to use a custom variant implementation (call it var1ant
    that does not have any exception stuff in it.
