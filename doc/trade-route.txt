TODO:

  * Add trade_route to unit orders.

  * Enable Trade Route menu item in orders menu.

  * Add the trade route data structure to ss.

  * Add 't' key to land view input.

  * Determine whether a load from a colony will load more than
    100, either when there are other things to load and when not.
    Maybe we should cycle around, loading 100 of each until a
    full cycle is made where nothing is loaded. Note that the
    same commodity can be added multiple times...

  * Note that the trade route edit screen allows editing the
    name.

  * When the wagon train lands in a colony, it does not do its
    loading/unloading until the start of the next turn.

  * When a unit starts a trade route, the gui allows selecting
    the starting location.

  * When creating a sea trade route, the harbor is among the
    available stops. However, second-stop menu does not include
    it, but probably should. In the OG it can be added in the
    trade route editing screen.

  * Need to support the fact that a trade route can be edited
    while there are units carrying it out.

  * Need to make sure that transacting in the harbor while on a
    trade route respects boycotts.

  * When a ship arrives in the harbor it will transact immedi-
    ately, and a message will be shown over the land view without
    showing the harbor. But then the ship waits until the next
    turn to sail back.

  * When a wagon train arrives at a colony or loads/unloads
    stuff, a brief message appears in the top bar. Not sure yet
    if we want to replicate this.

  * Need to limit the number of wagon trains per colony as in the
    OG, or perhaps find another way to limit their number, e.g.
    by increasing the cost exponentially for each one built. Or,
    if the wagon train remains stationary for more than x number
    of turns, any goods in it will spoil (!!). With a bit of in-
    telligence in this algorithm, it could work to allow an arbi-
    trary number of wagon trains without the player being able to
    exploit them for additional storage.

    This is important because simply limiting the number of wagon
    trains to the number of colonies can be cheated by creating a
    large number of temporary population-1 colonies and then
    building the wagon trains, then abandoning the colonies.

  * Wagon trains need to end their turn when entering a colony.

  * There is a strategy (described in the SG) whereby one can
    chain wagon train routes to move items within one turn a dis-
    tance much further than one wagon train can move. Doing this
    efficiently requires the player being able to set up wagon
    trains that move in a predictable order so that one can pick
    up where the prior one left off. Make sure this work.

  * Need a list of default name suffixes for trade routes.
