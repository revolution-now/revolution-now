Here are some links of detailed analyses of the Col1 combat sta-
tistics mechanism as well as a list of some of the bonuses and
penalties that are applied (very non-trivial):

Observations
============

  * If an ambush bonus is applied, it uses the terrain bonus of
    the square of the defender (counterintuitively) and the de-
    fender gets no terrain (defense) bonus.
  * It appears that the ambush bonus does not take effect if the
    defender is fortified.

Possibilities (TODO):

  * In NAMES.TXT there are two extra fields in the list of unit
    properties: "guns" and "hull". It is possible these are used
    to compute whether a ship is sunk or damaged.

Observations (make sense):

  * The evasion probability seems to be a linear function of the
    difference in total movement points between attacker and de-
    fender.

Observations (not make sense):

  * Non-war ships can never be sunk.
  * When attacker and defender are the same type, the evade prob-
    ability seems to be zero.
  * On privateer-vs-frigate, there is never an "evade" outcome.
    (more data needed).
  * On man-o-war-vs-privateer, the privateer (when lost) is al-
    ways sunk, never damaged. (more data needed).
  * When there are multiple ships on the defending square and the
    defender loses, all of the ships on the square will be either
    sunk or damaged. The non-war ships will be damaged, and the
    non-war ships will be sunk. This could potentially have been
    done because of the way that col1 represents units on ships,
    i.e. if only one ship were to be sunk and it contained a unit
    then the unit would have to be eliminated, but it wouldn't be
    clear in general which ship the unit was on. We may want to
    get rid of this rule... However, when the attacker loses (and
    there are units in the cargo of one of the ships on the at-
    tacker's square) the attacker and units go away, but the
    other ships on the attacker's square remain.
  * When an attacking ship loses, the other ships on its square
    are unaffected, but units on the square go away.
