Notes:

  * Computed once at the start of each turn, AFTER colonies are
    evolved. This ordering matters. The OG does it this way, and
    anyway is needed so that the number shown on the report is
    consistent with what is in the colonies for SoL.

  * When it reaches 50%, independence can be declared.

  * Also when it reaches 50%, the OG consolidates two of the AI
    players: according to the SG, the smallest one is ceded into
    the second smallest. If we do this, we need to determine how
    to handle rebel sentiment in the two that are merged. We
    don't want the merge to automatically trigger then declaring
    independence, since that'd be strange.

  * Need to determine if/how rebel sentiment affects the build up
    of ref forces.

  * There are messages that inform the player of when rebel sen-
    timent rises and falls, similar to the SoL messages. However,
    they are only shown when the total population is >= 4, and
    that includes all human units both in colonies, on the map,
    or on the dock, i.e. the `total_colonists` variable below.

    When rebel sentiment goes down, the message says "tory senti-
    ment is on the rise".

  * The sav file has one top-level field for rebel sentiment and
    then one in each nation. The top-level one seems to always be
    the same as the one for the human player.

  * Rebel sentiment contributes to the final score.

  * We need to warn the player when the number of rebels of for-
    eign powers rises and they get closer to declaring.

  * According to the SG, AI players will declare independence
    when they reach a certain number of rebels (i.e., it is not
    based on percent but on number of rebels):

        Discoverer:   80
        Explorer:     70
        Conquistador: 60
        Governor:     50
        Viceroy:      40

    Since this is based on absolute numbers of rebels and not
    rebel percentages (like it is for the human player) it is
    possible to prevent the AI from declaring independence just
    by attacking them to keep their nations small.

    This is an important case of how the rules differ for human
    vs. AI players. The cheat mode feature that allows switching
    the human player needs to handle this properly, i.e. if the
    human player has more rebels than the threshold for an AI
    player to declare independence, and then the human player is
    changed, the original player (which is now AI) will immedi-
    ately declare independence.

  * Rebel sentiment percent is given by:

                                  sum( SoL percent*population, colonies )
      rebel_percent = floor(  100*--------------------------------------- )
                                       total colonies population

  * Rebel sentiment spreads shown on the continental congress re-
    port are:

      rebel_count = rebel_percent*total_colonists
      tory_count  = total_colonies-rebel_count

    where the `total_colonists` is the total number of human
    colonists that the player has in the game, including:
      * native converts
      * human military units
      * units on the dock
    but not e.g. artillery or treasure units.
