Framebuffers TODO:
--------------------------------------------------

  * Add video settings menu to allow setting the post processing
    mode. This should ideally be stored in a per-installation
    config location.

  * Config parameters controlling framebuffer should be:

      - Direct to screen (no post processing).
      - Strict pixels.
      - Enable post processing effect X.

  * Only snap to pixel in viewport when in the pixelated mode.
    The viewport stuff needs to be looked at there... it causes
    weird behavior when in pixelated mode and zooming is happen-
    ing.

  * Fix rendering issues when zoomed out in pixelated mode:
      - Fog of war.
      - Sea lane animations.

  * Allow framebuffer to be the size of the physical screen so
    that we can get postprocessing without pixel enforcement.
