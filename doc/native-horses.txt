Native Horses

  * Difficulty level analysis.

Data/Definitions
----------------

  horse_herds: per tribe.

    * A tribe's horse_herd field indicates how many "herds" it has.
    * A tribe has horses if and only if this value is > 0.
    * When this value is > 0 then breeding can occur.
    * Allowed range: [0,inf)

  horse_breeding: per tribe.

    * The tribe's horse_breeding field increases each turn by an
      amount equal to horse_herds. When it reaches 25 or larger
      then a brave will move to a dwelling and will be given
      horses, and 25 will be subtracted from the value.

Acquisition
-----------

  * A brave without horses wins in battle against a unit with
    horses (even a scout), then ++horse_herds. But that doesn't
    seem to happen if the brave already has horses. Note that
    horse_breeding is not increased here because the brave is
    already receiving the horses.
  * Giving/selling horses to the tribe via trade. Note that
    this increases horse_breeding as well, by 25.
  * Attacking a colony and stealing horses during a raid. Seems
    to apply even if a small amount (e.g. 10) horses are
    stolen. This appears to increase horse_breeding as well by
    25, even when small numbers are stolen.
  * Demanding horses as reparations (probably is a part of the
    usual demands of whatever commodities the colony has in
    stock). In this case horse_herds goes up by one. The brave
    also gets horses. horse_breeding may go up, but not sure.
  * Inter-tribe trade

  Confirmed negative:
    * Brave with horses wins in battle against a unit with
      horses.
    * When a scout is captured when speaking to the chief.
    * Attacking a wagon train containing horses.

  * When a new horse herd is given to a tribe via trade, the
    horse_herds goes up by 1, but the horse_breeding field also
    goes up by an amount equal to:

       horse_breeding += floor( traded_amount/4 )

    When horses are acquired by combat only horse_herds increases
    by 1 since the brave will take the horses, which is equiva-
    lent to 25 horse_breeding.

  * Dwellings seem to trade horses according to normal rules,
    namely that they won't trade them twice in a row (although
    this needs to be confirmed; a violation of this may once have
    been observed while trading with an Inca capital).

  * If we only trade 1 horse with the natives, horse_herds still
    increases.

Horse Breeding
--------------

  * The tribe's horse_breeding field increases each turn by an
    amount equal to horse_herds. A brave requires 25 horses to
    get a horse. At some point later, when there is a brave in
    need of horses and that brave has moved over its dwelling,
    and this field is above 25, 25 will be subtracted from it and
    the brave will get a horse (even a brave that already ex-
    ists). However, in some cases it seems that the value sub-
    tracted is 50, but it is not understood how/why/when this
    happens (see bugs section below). It does not seem to be
    simply a function of horse_breeding. This quantity has a max-
    imum value, given by the following formula:

      max_value = 50 + N + D*M + a

    where D is the number of dwellings, N is (0,4,6,8) and M is
    (6,10,14,18) for the tech levels. Strangely, a is zero in all
    cases except for Semi-nomadic when D >= 9 (bug?).

  * The fact that there is some uncertainty in when 25 is sub-
    tracted from horse_breeding and a brave gets a horse can
    probably be explained by the fact that maybe a brave needs to
    wait until it returns to its dwelling to get the horses.

  * It seems that when a brave acquires horses that uses up its
    entire turn, so first it has to move onto its dwelling, then
    it has to acquire horses, then its turn ends.

  * Max value of horse_breeding (which seems independent of the
    value of horse_herds):

      Civilized (Inca):
         7 dwellings: 184  (Inca)     = 50 + 8 + 7*18
         3 dwellings: 112  (Inca)     = 50 + 8 + 3*18
         2 dwellings:  94  (Inca)     = 50 + 8 + 2*18
         1 dwellings:  76  (Inca)     = 50 + 8 + 1*18
         0 dwellings:  58  (Inca)     = 50 + 8 + 0*18

      Advanced (Aztec):
        16 dwellings: 280  (Aztec)    = 50 + 6 + 16*14
        10 dwellings: 196  (Aztec)    = 50 + 6 + 10*14
         8 dwellings: 168  (Aztec)    = 50 + 6 +  8*14

      Agrarian:
        13 dwellings: 184  (iroquois) = 50 + 4 + 13*10
        11 dwellings: 164  (iroquois) = 50 + 4 + 11*10
         4 dwellings:  94  (cherokee) = 50 + 4 +  4*10
         3 dwellings:  84  (cherokee) = 50 + 4 +  3*10
         1 dwellings:  64  (cherokee) = 50 + 4 +  1*10

      Semi-nomadic:
        13 dwellings: 130  (Sioux)    = 50 + 0 + 13*6 + 2
         9 dwellings: 106  (Sioux)    = 50 + 0 +  9*6 + 2
         8 dwellings:  98  (Sioux)    = 50 + 0 +  8*6
         7 dwellings:  92  (Sioux)    = 50 + 0 +  7*6
         6 dwellings:  86  (Sioux)    = 50 + 0 +  6*6
         5 dwellings:  80  (Sioux)    = 50 + 0 +  5*6
         4 dwellings:  74  (Sioux)    = 50 + 0 +  4*6
         3 dwellings:  68  (Sioux)    = 50 + 0 +  3*6
         2 dwellings:  62  (Sioux)    = 50 + 0 +  2*6
         1 dwellings:  56  (Sioux)    = 50 + 0 +  1*6
         0 dwellings:  50  (Sioux)    = 50 + 0 +  0*6

    If the value somehow ends up larger than this then it will be
    reduced.

Horse Loss
----------

  * It seems impossible for a tribe to completely lose horses
    once they acquire them, since having horse_herds > 0 will al-
    ways lead to breading, but it doesn't seem possible to get
    horse_herds to go down to zero without eliminating all
    dwellings.

  * When a brave with horses loses in combat there is a 50%
    chance that the tribe will retain the horses, which means
    that the horse_breeding number will increase by 25. Other-
    wise, the unit simply disappears and nothing else happens.

  * When a dwelling gets destroyed, both the horse_herds and the
    horse_breeding will decrease according to this formula:

      new_value = old_value - floor( old_value/N )

    where N is the number of dwellings including the one being
    destroyed. Using the floor is important so that guarantee
    that we always have some left for the remaining dwelling(s).

Inter-tribe Trade
-----------------

  * Happens via horse_herds, not horse_breeding.
  * Happens if and only if a brave from one tribe moves adjacent
    to a brave (or dwelling) from another tribe where at least
    one tribe has horse_herds > 0.
  * When a trade happens, both tribes end up with an amount of
    horse_herds equal to the maximum of the two values between
    the two tribes.
  * Since this happens iff braves meet, the question of how often
    it happens is equivalent to the question of when/how often
    braves meet. The answer seems to be that they never meet un-
    less they are forced to for some reason. The game must have
    some mechanism for preventing this. As part of implementing
    horse trading properly, we probably need to figure out how
    braves move.

Indian Advisor Report
---------------------

  * The horses readout on the indian advisor report does not in-
    clude the herds held by braves.

Bugs
----

  * This seems likely to be a bug, but the way that
    horse_breeding actually seems to get incremented is according
    to the following algo/formula:

      1. Pick one tribe (not sure how it chooses, but it is de-
         terministic it seems): Iroquois, Inca
      2. Increase horse_breediung by NE*horse_herds, where NE is
         the total number of non-extinct tribes as specified by
         the extinct flag.

    This behavior doesn't seem to make any sense; it could be a
    result of an incorrectly-implemented inter-tribe trading
    mechanism for horses.

  * When an existing brave gets horses it only requires 25 from
    horse_breeding, but when a new brave is created and receives
    horses off the bat, it appears to take 50 in cases where
    horse_breeding is over 50, otherwise it just takes 25. Not
    sure if this is a bug. But either way, we won't be repro-
    ducing it because it doesn't seem to make sense. Creating a
    new brave and equipping it with horses should require the
    same number of horses as creating it with horses. Also, the
    number of horses required even for creating a brave with
    horses seems inconsistent as it can be either 25 or 50 de-
    pending on the value of horse_breeding.
