                     Differences from the OG
=================================================================

                         Sinking Ships
                         -------------
  In the OG, When a ship is damaged/sunk, it affects all other
  ships on the square. The reason for this is not totally clear,
  but it could be a result of the way that the OG handles keeping
  units on ships and how when multiple ships are on the same
  square it is ambiguous as to which ship each unit is on (in
  fact, they can switch ships). When there are multiple ships on
  the defending square and the defender loses, all of the ships
  on the square will be either sunk or damaged. The non-war ships
  will be damaged, and the non-war ships will be sunk. However,
  when the attacker loses (and there are units in the cargo of
  one of the ships on the attacker's square) the attacker and
  units go away, but the other ships on the attacker's square re-
  main. When an attacking ship loses, the other ships on its
  square are unaffected, but units on the square go away, which
  gives credibility to our hypothesis as to the reason for this.
  So when a ship is sunk, the game is not sure on which ship the
  units were, so it needs to just damage/sink all of them, which
  it also does for consistency even when there are no units on-
  board. In RN none of this happens; ship battles are treated ex-
  actly the same as land battles when there are multiple units on
  a square.

                Naval Battle Mechanics & Navy Size
                ----------------------------------
  The mechanics of naval battles are retained to a very high de-
  gree of accuracy, with the exception of one thing: the OG seems
  to skew the results of ship battles according to the overall
  size of the players' navies, perhaps with the intention of dis-
  couraging large naval fleets by making it more likely that
  ships will sink (rather than be damaged) in such a situation.
  In RN we do not do that.

                    Ships in Abandoned Colony
                    -------------------------
  In the OG, when a colony is abandoned, any ships in port are
  left on the square. Then if you try to attack on with a land
  unit the game panics. In RN, whenever a colony goes away for
  any reason, any ships left in port are marked as damaged and
  moved for repair. If there is no port available for repair then
  they are destroyed.

                    Units on Ships in a Colony
                    --------------------------
  In the OG it is not possible to actually put a unit on a ship;
  the unit just remains on the map and travels with the ship.
  When it is in a colony, it is sentried, then when the next ship
  leaves the units will move with it. This mechanism has prob-
  lems, most notably the fact that two ships on the same square
  both with units in their cargo lose track of which units were
  on which ship. In RN, a unit can actually be on the cargo of a
  ship, just like commodities. However, this does raise a ques-
  tion as to what happens when a colony is attacked and said
  colony has a ship in port containing a military unit in its
  cargo? Another question is, when a colony is destroyed by
  braves and the ships are sent for repair, what should happen to
  the units in the cargo? The position that RN takes is that
  whenever there is an ambiguity having to do with units being in
  the cargo of a ship that is on a land square, those units (or
  unit) will be offboarded from the ship and then the behavior of
  the OG will be applied. So for example, when a ship in a colony
  port containing military units is attacked, one of those mili-
  tary units, if chosen to defend, will be offboarded from the
  ship to defend, and then will remain at the gate. When a colony
  is destroyed or captured, all units are offboarded first, then
  things proceed as usual as if those units had been at the gate
  all along. The basic idea is that we want to replicate the be-
  havior of the OG in all cases except for the bugs/problems as-
  sociated with the ambiguity arising when two ships with unit
  cargos are on the same ocean square (which is fixed in RN).

                Disbanding Units on Ships at Sea
                --------------------------------
  Likely related to this is the fact that the OG forbids dis-
  banding a ship at sea that contains units. The reason for this
  is probably that, if it were to allow it, it would only be able
  to allow it when there is a single ship on the square in order
  to avoid the ambiguity problem of which units are on the ship.
  For consistency, the designers probably just decided to forbid
  it completely. The workaround is to just select the units on
  the ship and activate them individually and disband them before
  disbanding the ship, with the same effect. There is an edge
  case where one of the units on the ship cannot be activated be-
  cause it has already moved this turn, but that is probably
  rare. Thus, in RN we allow it by default, since it 1) has no
  ambiguity problems, 2) there is a workaround for it anyway,
  thus preventing it would just make things more difficult for
  the player without any reason.

  Note that, even in the OG, this issue does not arise for ships
  in colony ports, since they can't hold units either; any units
  on the square are at the colony gate, and so the OG allows dis-
  banding ships there since it doesn't require destroying the
  units. In order to mimic this, when we destroy a ship con-
  taining units in a colony port, we will first offboard those
  units, in accordance with the principles layed out in sections
  above that seek to always replicate the OG's behavior with re-
  spect to units on ships, where there would be an ambiguity due
  to the fact that the NG does support units on ships properly.
