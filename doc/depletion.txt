Silver/Minerals Depletion
-------------------------

In the OG:

  * Each colony has a counter called the "depletion counter".
  * The counter starts at zero and increases when there is a
    colonist mining ore on a minerals resource or silver on ei-
    ther a minerals resource or an undepleted silver resource.
  * The counter keeps increasing until it hits a limit, and can
    never go down until it hits that limit.
  * When the counter hits the limit it gets reset to zero and all
    prime resources currently being worked in the colony get de-
    pleted, no matter how long they've been worked.
  * The counter limit is 50 on all difficulty levels.
  * Temporarily removing colonists from mining will stop the
    counter from incrementing, but it does not cause the counter
    to decrease or reset; it cannot go down until it hits the
    limit.
  * The counter increase each turn according to the following
    formula, which is applied to each relevant worker and summed:

        counter_delta =  A1*X1 + A2*X2 + A3*X3 + ...
                        (unit1) (unit2) (unit3)
    where:

        Xn is a random bernoulli variable with probability:

          p = 1-1/(2+D)

        where D is the difficulty level (D=1 on discoverer). Thus:

          p = .50 on discoverer
          p = .66 on explorer
          p = .75 on conquistador
          p = .80 on governor
          p = .83 on viceroy

        An is a multipler that depends on what is being mined and on
        what kind of tile.

          2 for silver on minerals
          1 for silver on silver
          0 for silver on depleted silver
          1 for ore    on minerals
          0 for ore    on silver
          0 for ore    on depleted silver

In the NG:

  * The mechanism used by the OG is fine when there is only one
    such tile being worked in a colony. But as soon as you intro-
    duce a second then you get a couple of non-sensical issues:

      1. Two tiles being worked means that depletion time for
         both is only half. This means that if a colony has two
         prime silver tiles and works both, it will end up with
         no more silver than if it had just one tile.
      2. The depletion of one tile automatically causes the de-
         pletion of the other prime tiles that are being worked,
         even if those other tiles have only been worked for one
         turn.

    These really makes no sense, so we're going to keep the be-
    havior for when there is one tile, but change it for when
    there are multiple.
  * This new mechanic should be equivalent to the OG's when there
    is only one such prime tile being worked in a colony at a
    time, which is probably the vast majority of cases. So there-
    fore this change should not have too much of an effect on
    gameplay except in some less common cases, where the new be-
    havior will make more sense to the player.
  * There will be a dictionary (tile -> int) in the terrain data
    that will be populated with a tile once that tile starts to
    get worked by any nation.
  * Each turn it is worked, the counter will be increased by
    a formula similar to the OG's:

      counter_delta = A*X

    where A and X are exactly as given in the case of the OG.
  * The counter can never decrease, and is agnostic to which na-
    tion is working the tile (even if the nation changes half way
    through).
  * When the counter hits 50 the resource on that particular tile
    is depleted and the counter is removed from the map.

SAV interoperability:

  * Since the new mechanism will require a different data repre-
    sentation than that of the OG, a question arises as to how to
    convert between them. The conversion will not be perfect, but
    again it should be loss-less in the common case where there
    is only one silver/minerals resource being worked at a time
    in a colony.

  * NG -> OG: Find all the prime resources that are being worked
    in the vicinty of the colony, take the **AVERAGE** of their
    counters, and set that as the OG's colony counter.
  * OG -> NG: Take the OG's counter and find all of the colony's
    tiles that are currently being worked and set the counter for
    each one of them.

  * The above has the following properties:

      1. Consistent roundtrip starting from either OG or NG in
         the common case of only one tile worked.
      2. Consistent roundtrip starting from the OG in all cases.
      3. Consistent roundtrip starting from the NG when there are
         multiple tiles being worked all with the same counter.
      4. Lossy roundtrip when starting from the NG when there are
         multiple tiles being worked with different counters.

    So only #4 has some loss, but the average function used should
    help to make the transition as equivalent as possible.
