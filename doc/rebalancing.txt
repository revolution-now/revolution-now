This doc lists some ideas for rebalancing the special abilities
of the four european nations. It seems to be the case that people
generally feel that the Dutch overall have the strongest advan-
tages (slower price movement and merchantman), so here we will
list some possibilities for bringing the four nations on par. In-
stead of reducing the abilities of the Dutch, we will increase
the abilities of the other nations, since that seems like it
would produce a more fun game since there'd be a more diverse set
of possible strategies.

  French:

    * Hardy pioneer.
    * Reduced native alarm rate.
    * The french start with Jean de Brebeuf, so all missionaries
      function as experts.
    * The cost of blessing missionaries in europe does not in-
      crease (see general changes section).

  Spanish:

    * Veteran soldier.
    * In addition to the 50% bonus when attacking native
      dwellings, they get a 50% bonus in any combat against na-
      tives.
    * When burning a native village it yields more treasure on
      average (50%?), when it yields treasure. This will compound
      with Hernan Cortez. Another option would have been to give
      the Spanish Hernan Cortez at the start of the game, but
      that might be too much since that also means that the king
      transports the treasure free of charge, which makes a huge
      difference in the early game.

  English:

    * 2/3 crosses needed to attract immigrants as usual.
    * Probability of criminals and servants appearing on the dock
      is noticeably lower than for the other nations, though not
      zero. Another option would have been to give the English
      William Brewster at the start of the game, but that might
      be a bit too much.

  General changes to the game:

    * The player has to pay to bless missionaries in Europe, with
      an increasing cost as with artillery. This does two things:
      First, it incentivizes building a church and makes churches
      more valuable. Second, it allows giving the French an ad-
      vantage in that the cost of blessing missionaries for them
      does not increase.

    * Shipyards. The strategy guide says: "A Shipyard is useful
      if you require many ships or engage in much sea combat, but
      many experienced players will find that it can be ignored
      in favor of other construction projects."  :-(

      We need to make a change to make ship-building more attrac-
      tive. Some ideas:

        * Lower the building cost of ships.
        * Create a new attractive ship unit that can only be
          built in the new world. A ship that can be used to bom-
          bard land units could be one such unit.
        * Allow building Man-o-Wars with the ship yard.

      The strategy guide goes on to say: "Colonies' Ships are of
      maximum usefulness before the start qf the war of indepen-
      dence. Afler the war begins they can no longer travel to
      Europe and back, and most are easily sunk or damaged by the
      King's Man-o-War ships. The resources invested in Shipyards
      may be better utilized in other areas in preparation for
      declaring independence." -- Decide if this needs fixing.
