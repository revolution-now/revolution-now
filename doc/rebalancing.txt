This doc lists some ideas for rebalancing the special abilities
of the four european nations. It seems to be the case that people
generally feel that the Dutch overall have the strongest advan-
tages (slower price movement and merchantman), so here we will
list some possibilities for bringing the four nations on par. In-
stead of reducing the abilities of the Dutch, we will increase
the abilities of the other nations, since that seems like it
would produce a more fun game since there'd be a more diverse set
of possible strategies.

  French:

    * Hardy pioneer.
    * Reduced native alarm rate.
    * The french start with Jean de Brebeuf, so all missionaries
      function as experts.
    * The cost of blessing missionaries in europe does not in-
      crease (see general changes section).

  Spanish:

    * Veteran soldier.
    * In addition to the 50% bonus when attacking native
      dwellings, they get a 50% bonus in any combat against na-
      tives.
    * When burning a native village it yields more treasure on
      average (50%?), when it yields treasure. This will compound
      with Hernan Cortez. Another option would have been to give
      the Spanish Hernan Cortez at the start of the game, but
      that might be too much since that also means that the king
      transports the treasure free of charge, which makes a huge
      difference in the early game.

  English:

    * 2/3 crosses needed to attract immigrants as usual.
    * Probability of criminals and servants appearing on the dock
      is noticeably lower than for the other nations, though not
      zero. Another option would have been to give the English
      William Brewster at the start of the game, but that might
      be a bit too much.

Founding Father Enhancements:

  * Paul Revere:

    Paul Revere will allow a colonist to pick up stockpiled mus-
    kets. In the original game it appears that this will only
    happen once no matter how many muskets are in the colony. For
    this reason Paul Revere is considered not to be worth much.
    However, in order to make him worth more, we can expand his
    effects to have the colonist (a veteran if available) keep
    taking up as many muskets and horses as are available repeat-
    edly until they are gone, fighting as if he was a dragoon or
    soldier each time (possibly with a fortification bonus). Only
    when they are all depeleted does he fight like a normal
    colonist, and that will be the last battle as usual if he
    loses. This would allow e.g. a colony with a warehouse expan-
    sion to have 300 horses, and 300 muskets, and a veteran
    colonist working somewhere in the colony, but no military de-
    fending its gates, and this would be equivalent to having six
    fortified veteran dragoons defending the colony! This might
    actually make Revere too powerful, maybe the colonists should
    only pick up muskets and not also horses.

    On a related note, figure out how to deal with military units
    that are in the cargo of ships in the port of the colony
    being attacked. This issue doesn't come up in the original
    game. Maybe Paul Revere could enable them to fight?

General changes to the game:

  * The player has to pay to bless missionaries in Europe, with
    an increasing cost as with artillery. This does two things:
    First, it incentivizes building a church and makes churches
    more valuable. Second, it allows giving the French an advan-
    tage in that the cost of blessing missionaries for them does
    not increase.

  * Shipyards. The strategy guide says: "A Shipyard is useful if
    you require many ships or engage in much sea combat, but many
    experienced players will find that it can be ignored in favor
    of other construction projects." :-(

    We need to make a change to make ship-building more attrac-
    tive. Some ideas:

      * Lower the building cost of ships.
      * Create a new attractive ship unit that can only be built
        in the new world. A ship that can be used to bombard land
        units could be one such unit.
      * Allow building Man-o-Wars with the ship yard.

    The strategy guide goes on to say: "Colonies' Ships are of
    maximum usefulness before the start qf the war of indepen-
    dence. Afler the war begins they can no longer travel to Eu-
    rope and back, and most are easily sunk or damaged by the
    King's Man-o-War ships. The resources invested in Shipyards
    may be better utilized in other areas in preparation for de-
    claring independence." -- Decide if this needs fixing.

  * The rule where one cannot abandon a colony with a stockade
    seems to be unpopular, frustrating, and nonsensical. We
    should probably figure out why that was done and try to get
    the same effect in another way. Clearly there was a desire to
    prevent the player from abandoning large colonies (either
    after capturing them, or maybe just before the war of inde-
    pendence). Maybe we can introduce another way of preventing
    that. Ideas could be:

      * Once a colony goes above 50% SoL it cannot be abandoned.
      * If a colony exists at population >= 3 for longer than N
        turns then it cannot be abandoned.
      * more?

    Also we should come up with a name for the propery that the
    colony receives which prevents it from being abandoned.
