Native Muskets/Horses Retention
===============================

Stealing from battle: the natives will steal muskets and/or
horses if and only if they are the attackers and they win.

Regarding the muskets and horses that each tribe has stored, here
are some observations:

  * Each brave with muskets accounts for 50 out of the total
    amount of the tribe.  The converse may not be true.

  * The number of muskets in the tribe can grow even long after
    having sold them.

  * Selling muskets: when selling muskets to a tribe, the amount
    sold gets multiplied, but only sometimes. E.g., upon selling
    100 muskets to a tribe, in one case the tribe was then listed
    as having only 50 muskets, and it remained that way. Another
    time it was listed as having 100 initially, and it grew to
    250 on its own. Another time it was 150 and remained con-
    stant.

  * When disbanding a brave, the tribe will lose 50 muskets. So
    the game's reading on number of muskets per tribe must be in-
    cluding free braves.

  * When defeating an armed brave in combat, the tribe's musket
    count goes down sometimes, but not others. Even in the cases
    where we defeat all armed braves but one, the total musket
    count quickly goes back up to e.g. 300. The tribe seems to
    produce muskets provided that it has at least 50.

  * Once a tribe's musket count goes to zero it stays there.

Still not sure how it really works; there must be some internal
stash together with some kind of growth factor and randomness.
Might need to look in the sav files to understand it.
