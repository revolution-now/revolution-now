Here are some links of detailed analyses of the Col1 combat sta-
tistics mechanism as well as a list of some of the bonuses and
penalties that are applied (very non-trivial):

Observations
============

  * If an ambush bonus is applied, it uses the terrain bonus of
    the square of the defender (counterintuitively) and the de-
    fender gets no terrain (defense) bonus.
  * It appears that the ambush bonus does not take effect if the
    defender is fortified.
