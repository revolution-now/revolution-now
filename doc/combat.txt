Combat bonuses and calculations in the OG are /highly/ non-trivial.
It is recommended to read this links:

Key Notes
=========

  * The fortification bonus (when it is applied, which is not in
    all the cases that you might think) gets added to the other
    fortification bonuses, not multiplied on its own, despite
    what the combat analysis makes it seem like. So if defending
    a colony, which comes with a 50% bonus (no stockade/fort/-
    fortress) then the a unit fortification bonus of a defending
    unit (+50%) actually gets added to the colony fortification
    bonus, so it is +100%, not 1.5*1.5. This fortification bonus
    seems to be the only one that acts like this.
  * There are hidden bonuses and penalties -- need to read the
    above pages.
  * Many more points. Read the above pages.

Ambush
======

  * If an ambush bonus is applied, it uses the terrain bonus of
    the square of the defender (counterintuitively) and the de-
    fender gets no terrain (defense) bonus.
  * It appears that the ambush bonus does not take effect if the
    defender is fortified.
