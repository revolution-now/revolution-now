  * Goto needs to be cleared after an attack.
  * Any unit in goto mode travelling such that it doesn't actu-
    ally move tiles in the process (landfall, enter dwelling, at-
    tack dwelling, enter foreign colony, needs to be animated
    moving into it so that:
      1. so that the viewport pans there, and
      2. so that the player is reminded of which unit it is and
         what the unit is doing.
  * Goto tile via keyboard.
  * Consider adding the "go to port" command to the right click
    context menu on land-view.
  * Do another attempt at finding any additional goto state in
    the OG's sav files.

Done:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

  * Goto colony.
  * Goto europe.
  * As a ship uncovers tiles while trying to find sea lane, we
    might want to somehow recompute the path after re-checking
    the ships surroundings.
  * Omniscient goto mode as in OG.
  * Add a new method to the IGotoMapViewer to return the movement
    cost of a tile. That will be added to the `steps` in the
    a-star algo which should automatically cause the path on land
    to e.g. avoid mountains if possible. This could be tested in
    the case where there is an adjacent mountain tile and then
    another adjacent grassland tile that is connected to the
    mountain tile via a road; traveling to the mountain tile
    should go via the road.
  * Consider adding arrows when dragging to adjacent tiles.

  Strategies:

    * Goto europe:

        Expand circle outward, assuming hidden tiles are travers-
        able, and find the first sea lane. Assume that tiles
        along the right/left edge are sea lane, though even if
        they are not, that is still ok because once we get there
        we can move off the map. If there is no sea lane then
        that needs to be handled.

    * Goto tile:

        Do a-star assuming hidden tiles are traversable.

    * Generally, connectivity checking should not be needed oth-
      erwise it might leak info to the player.
