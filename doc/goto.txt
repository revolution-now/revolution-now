TODO:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

  * In mouse mode, we cannot drag off the right/left edge of the
    map like we can in keyboard mode.
  * When in keyboard mode, need to be able to center on the fo-
    cused tile.
  * In keyboard mode, need to fix the fact that moving the cursor
    near the edge of the screen causing things to scroll too
    fast.
  * In mouse mode, it would be nice to have a way to gently
    scroll when the mouse moves to the edge.
  * e_goto_target_snapshot should be turned into a sumtype to
    capture tribe and player.
  * Do another attempt at finding any additional goto state in
    the OG's sav files.

Done:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

  * Goto colony.
  * Goto europe.
  * As a ship uncovers tiles while trying to find sea lane, we
    might want to somehow recompute the path after re-checking
    the ships surroundings.
  * Omniscient goto mode as in OG.
  * Add a new method to the IGotoMapViewer to return the movement
    cost of a tile. That will be added to the `steps` in the
    a-star algo which should automatically cause the path on land
    to e.g. avoid mountains if possible. This could be tested in
    the case where there is an adjacent mountain tile and then
    another adjacent grassland tile that is connected to the
    mountain tile via a road; traveling to the mountain tile
    should go via the road.
  * Consider adding arrows when dragging to adjacent tiles.
  * Consider adding the "go to port" command to the right click
    context menu on land-view.
  * Goto needs to be cleared after an attack.
  * Need to ensure Goto units are visible before evolving them
    since they may engage in an interaction that doesn't involve
    moving or any animations and therefore a prompt might come up
    referring to a unit that is not on screen.
  * Goto tile via keyboard.
  * Land units should try to avoid LCRs when navigating, if pos-
    sible.
  * There is a potential problem with saving:
      - If the player initiates a goto, then saves and reloads,
        the path will be recomputed. This is ok, but then the
        original saved target contents will be lost. So that
        means the saved target contents need to go into the save
        state, either in the unit's commands, or in some other
        location.
      - Make sure that things work as well when saving/loading
        from OG sav files.
  * If there is a different (foreign) society on the destination
    square when a land unit arrives as was there when the move
    was issued then the goto should stop short of going to the
    destination tile, otherwise e.g. if the player moves a unit
    onto an empty square and then there is a native unit on that
    tile by the time it gets there then it could automatically
    attack that native unit without asking the player (if the
    player is already at war with them).
  * If the target of a ship's goto was hidden at the time that it
    was selected by the user then, when the ship arrives there,
    it should not sail the high seas even if that tile is in sea
    lane.

  Strategies:

    * Goto europe:

        Expand circle outward, assuming hidden tiles are travers-
        able, and find the first sea lane. Assume that tiles
        along the right/left edge are sea lane, though even if
        they are not, that is still ok because once we get there
        we can move off the map. If there is no sea lane then
        that needs to be handled.

    * Goto tile:

        Do a-star assuming hidden tiles are traversable.

    * Generally, connectivity checking should not be needed oth-
      erwise it might leak info to the player.
