TODO:

  * Get rid of the command build, don't need it.
  * Units should not attack when they are en route to a tile
    that is different than the one they'd attack on.
  * Goto colony.
  * Goto europe.
  * Omnipotent goto mode as in OG.
  * Goto tile via keyboard.


Strategies:

  * Goto europe:

      Expand circle outward, assuming hidden tiles are traversa-
      ble, and find the first sea lane. Assume that tiles along
      the right/left edge are sea lane, though even if they are
      not, that is still ok because once we get there we can move
      off the map. If there is no sea lane then that needs to be
      handled.

  * Goto tile:

      Do a-star assuming hidden tiles are traversable.

  * Generally, connectivity checking should not be needed other-
    wise it might leak info to the player.
