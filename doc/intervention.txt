Todo:

  * Bells generated by REF-captured colonies don't count toward
    the intervention force (should be verified, but very likely
    true, or at least should be true; the SG implies this).

Done:

  * The transports of the intervention force seem to attempt to
    max out the number of units per ride (i.e., 6), ignoring the
    proporations of each unit type. This is a opposed to the REF
    which follows a different mechanism.

  * When the intervention force can't find an ocean spot (with
    sea lane access) adjacent to a colony that is available for
    friendly units then it will not deliver on that turn.

  * The intervention force moves (i.e. arrives) after the REF
    move:

       1. Natives.
       2. Euro players.
       3. REF.
       4. Intervention force.

  * The triggering of the intervention force is checked during
    the intervention force's turn. If it is sent then it begins
    that very turn (immediately).

  * The number of liberty bells needed for intervention:

        Discoverer:   2000
        Explorer:     3500
        Conquistador: 5000
        Governor:     6500
        Viceroy:      8000

    The SG claims that this number is equal to the number of
    bells that would have been needed for the next founding fa-
    ther, but this doesn't seem to be the case. It is just deter-
    mined by difficulty level and is a relatively large value.
