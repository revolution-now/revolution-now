Naval Combat
============

Algo:

  1. Let attack=can_attack?combat:0; if attack for defender is >=
     attack for attacker then there is no evade. Otherwise, the
     evade probability will be computed according to the formula
     m_defender/(m_attacker+m_defender), where m_defender is the
     number of start-of-turn movement points of the attacker and
     m_defender is the number of the defender. In other words,
     we're not using the number of movement points that the unit
     actually has at the time of the battle, but rather the ini-
     tial movement point value that it would have at the start of
     a turn. And remember to apply the Ferdinand Magellan move-
     ment point bonus where applicable. Also, there is a bonus
     that is applied for the privateer (whether attacker or de-
     fender) whereby it gets is effective movement points doubled
     for the purposes of the calculation. That makes it much more
     difficult to evade a privateer and makes the privateer
     better at evading when attacked.
  2. If either there is no evade possible or if the evade dice
     roll yielded no evade, then we proceed to the combat analy-
     sis.
  3. Weigh each of the combat factors, giving the 50% bonus to
     the attacker and 50% Francis Drake bonus (where applicable),
     as usual. Whichever ship wins will be unchanged (or moved,
     in the case of a winning attacker), and the losing ship will
     be either damaged or sunk.
  4. The probability of sinking is equal to
     "guns"_winner/("guns"_winner+"hull"_loser). I.e., the proba-
     bility that the "guns of the winner can penetrate the hull
     of the loser."
  5. Note: the OG makes a significant adjustment to the sinking
     probability (if not a complete override) having to do with
     the size of each player's naval fleet, in that a ship is
     much more likely to sink if the player's navy is large
     and/or they already have many damaged ships. This is likely
     done to discourage or put a check on large navies. But, we
     will not replicate that in this game. See the
     naval-mechanics.txt doc file for more info on this, though
     the exact mechanism used by the OG seems convoluted and is
     not fully understood.

Evasion:

  * Let attack=can_attack?combat:0; if attack for defender is >=
    attack for attacker then there is no evade, in which case we
    move on to the combat calculation. If there is an evade, we
    compute the probability of it first and roll the dice.
  * The evade probability is computed from the weighted movement
    points between the two units, similarly to how combat
    strengths are weighted.
  * The evasion probability seems to be a linear function of the
    difference in total movement points between attacker and de-
    fender, when it is non-zero.

Sinking vs. damaged:

  * The determination as to whether or not a ship sinks is nomi-
    nally determined by the relative values of the "guns" and
    "hull" parameters of the two ships (guns for the winner, hull
    for the loser, weighed relatively just like combat
    strengths). The intention was probably to say that "a ship
    will sink if the winner's guns can penetrate the loser's
    hull." This probably seems to be computed and applied as
    stated when the two naval armies are small. However:
  * The determination as to whether or not a ship sinks seems to
    also be strongly affected by the total strength of that play-
    er's navy, possibly in relation to that of the attacker, and
    also possibly related to how many damaged ships the player
    already has (not sure). This has been mentioned on the wiki
    here:

      https://civilization.fandom.com/wiki/FAQ_on_naval_combat_(Col)

    and says the following:

      "Long experience playing Colonization indicates that there
      is a weighing factor in naval combat which is based on how
      heavily your navy outnumbers your opponents navy. The
      bigger your navy is, the greater the chance your ships will
      lose in combat. What's more, ships don't just lose more,
      they lose harder - your ships are much more likely to be
      sunk.

      Interestingly, though, this weighing factor only seems to
      be applied when your ships attack other ships. If other
      ships attack you, combat proceeds as normal.

      The only real solution to this is to keep your navy reason-
      ably small; two or three privateers and one or two
      frigates."

    As usual, this may not be entirely correct, but the gist of
    it definitely seems to be born out.

    This is not mentioned in the strategy guide, and also the me-
    chanics of it seem a bit convoluted, so it is unclear how ex-
    actly it works. Essentially though, if one nations armies are
    much stronger, then, when it loses, its ships will tend to
    sink instead of get damaged with 100% probability.
  * Non-war ships (i.e., with zero attack) can never be sunk.
    When we change NAMES.TXT to give e.g. a Galleon a non-zero
    combat factor, the the game will allow it to sink.

Multiple units per square:

  Note that we won't be replicating these rules, since they seem
  to be a consequence of the way that the OG represents units on
  ships.

  * When there are multiple ships on the defending square and the
    defender loses, all of the ships on the square will be either
    sunk or damaged. The non-war ships will be damaged, and the
    non-war ships will be sunk. This could potentially have been
    done because of the way that col1 represents units on ships,
    i.e. if only one ship were to be sunk and it contained a unit
    then the unit would have to be eliminated, but it wouldn't be
    clear in general which ship the unit was on. We may want to
    get rid of this rule... However, when the attacker loses (and
    there are units in the cargo of one of the ships on the at-
    tacker's square) the attacker and units go away, but the
    other ships on the attacker's square remain.
  * When an attacking ship loses, the other ships on its square
    are unaffected, but units on the square go away.

====================

Note that some of the below is reliable but some of it may not
be, either due to sample size or incorrect experiment setup. But,
enough was done to be confident in the model described above.
