                  Corrections to Bad Mechanics
=================================================================
This doc lists some outright changes that will be made to the NG
to correct problems in the OG related to aspects of the design
that either likely arose from hacky design decisions or design
oversights that cause problems.

           Units Surrounding Island On Coast Tiles
           ---------------------------------------
  Some have said that one of the biggest unresolved isues in the
  OG is the fact that (pre-REF) an island can be made inacces-
  sible to european rivals by simply putting colonists on all of
  its coast tiles. This can happen intentially by the player as a
  way to "cheat" and not have to deal with european rivals, or it
  can happen inadvertantly by the AI when e.g. a two-tile island
  gets occupied by two units of different nations (this latter
  scenario is unresolvable by either the player, AI, or REF).

  Here are some ideas for fixes:

    1. Create some mechanism (ideally as non-intrusive as possi-
       ble) to allow a bombardment of a land unit from either a
       ship or a unit on a ship.
    2. ???

               Limit on Number of Wagon Trains
               -------------------------------
  Apparently they put a limit on the number of wagon trains that
  can be built in order to prevent the player from using them as
  extra storage in a colony. This seems kind of like a hacky de-
  sign decision. Maybe we can allow an arbitrary number of wagon
  trains, but tackle the storage issue differently, here are some
  ideas:

    1. Any cargo that has been left on a wagon train for more
       than N turns will spoil and be lost.
    2. If you have a number of wagon trains beyond your number of
       colonies then they require paying an upkeep cost each
       turn, which should rise sharply as the number goes above
       the number of colonies.

              Abandoning Colonies with Stockades
              ----------------------------------
  Everybody seems to agree that this is annoying and makes no sense.
  It was likely a hacky design decision to prevent the player from
  doing the following:

    1. Founding a large number of colonies, using them to earn
       gold, then abandoning them before the revolution in order
       to minimize cross section to the ref.
    2. Conquering other nations' colonies and then just aban-
       doning them, effectively destroying them.

  We should decided whether these principles are good to begin.
  If we change them then it could have a significant impact on
  gameplay, especially allowing #2. So let's assume that we want
  to keep at least #2 intact. Here are some other ideas for how
  to do that:

    1. ???
