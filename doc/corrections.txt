                  Corrections to Bad Mechanics
=================================================================
This doc lists some outright changes that will be made to the NG
to correct problems in the OG related to aspects of the design
that either likely arose from hacky design decisions or design
oversights that cause problems.

           Units Surrounding Island On Coast Tiles
           ---------------------------------------
  Some have said that one of the biggest unresolved isues in the
  OG is the fact that (pre-REF) an island can be made inacces-
  sible to european rivals by simply putting colonists on all of
  its coast tiles. This can happen intentially by the player as a
  way to "cheat" and not have to deal with european rivals, or it
  can happen inadvertantly by the AI when e.g. a two-tile island
  gets occupied by two units of different nations (this latter
  scenario is unresolvable by either the player, AI, or REF).

  An important thing to note about this is that, in practice, the
  game is played with one human against three AI players. And in
  practice the AI players are never going to surround an island
  with colonists. So solving this problem is really more about
  introducing a mechanism to allow the AI to prevent the player
  from taking advantage of it.

  There seems to really be only one plausible idea that would
  solve the issue without being too intrusive on the existing
  game mechanics, and that is to allow a ship (or a unit on a
  ship) to bombard/attack a land unit. Here are a couple of
  variations on that:

    1. A warship carrying at least one artillery unit can bombard
       a land unit. However, each time it does so, regardless of
       whether it wins or loses, one of the artillery on the ship
       gets demoted (or destroyed if it was already a "damaged"
       artillery). This way, the total number of such attacks
       that could be made by a ship would be 2 times the number
       of artillery units it contains. Given how expensive ar-
       tillery units are, this might be a good way to prevent it
       from being overused. As for the unit being attacked: if it
       loses then it is always destroyed. The bombardment techni-
       cally happens by the ship unit, so each ship can only do
       one per turn, since normally an attack exhausts a unit's
       movement points.
    2. If #1 needs to be limited even more, then it could be lim-
       ited to frigates.

  In the above, limiting the number of artillery on the ship (or
  creating a new special bombardment ship that only contains one
  cargo slot) would probably not be effective because the player
  coudl get around it by just bringing another ship along with
  more artillery to load.

  One potential downside to allowing it in general would be that
  a unit could attack from a ship, but then opposing units on
  land would not be able to attack it in return. So maybe what
  would happen is that it attacks and, if it wins, then it moves
  onto thd land tile and ends its turn, allowing it to be at-
  tacked.

  It may be tempting to enable this bombardment capability only
  after having acquired a founding father. But remember that this
  mechanic is mainly for the AI to use against the player, and
  the game in general is kind of ambiguous about whether or not
  other players get founding fathers. But even if they do, it may
  not be a good idea to make the AI get a founding father to use
  the mechanic because that might require an AI that is more ad-
  vanced then the one that we will likely end up with.

               Limit on Number of Wagon Trains
               -------------------------------
  Apparently they put a limit on the number of wagon trains that
  can be built in order to prevent the player from using them as
  extra storage in a colony. This seems kind of like a hacky de-
  sign decision. Maybe we can allow an arbitrary number of wagon
  trains, but tackle the storage issue differently, here are some
  ideas:

    1. Any cargo that has been left on a wagon train for more
       than N turns will spoil and be lost.
    2. If you have a number of wagon trains beyond your number of
       colonies then they require paying an upkeep cost each
       turn, which should rise sharply as the number goes above
       the number of colonies.

              Abandoning Colonies with Stockades
              ----------------------------------
  Everybody seems to agree that this is annoying and makes no sense.
  It was likely a hacky design decision to prevent the player from
  doing the following:

    1. Founding a large number of colonies, using them to earn
       gold, then abandoning them before the revolution in order
       to minimize cross section to the ref.
    2. Conquering other nations' colonies and then just aban-
       doning them, effectively destroying them.

  We should decided whether these principles are good to begin.
  If we change them then it could have a significant impact on
  gameplay, especially allowing #2. So let's assume that we want
  to keep at least #2 intact. Here are some other ideas for how
  to do that:
