Native Muskets
==============

Acquisition
-----------

  * There does not seem to be any inter-tribe trading of muskets.
    The SG mentions it though, so it may be a bug that it is
    omitted, or perhaps we just don't know the mechanism. It does
    not seem to happen automatically when braves of two tribes
    come into contact as is done with horses.

Native Horses
=============

Acquisition
-----------

  * Inter-tribe trade.

Inter-tribe Trade
-----------------

  * Happens via horse_herds, not horse_breeding.
  * Happens if and only if a brave from one tribe moves adjacent
    to a brave (or dwelling) from another tribe where at least
    one tribe has horse_herds > 0.
  * When a trade happens, both tribes end up with an amount of
    horse_herds equal to the maximum of the two values between
    the two tribes.
  * Since this happens iff braves meet, the question of how often
    it happens is equivalent to the question of when/how often
    braves meet. The answer seems to be that they never meet un-
    less they are forced to for some reason. The game must have
    some mechanism for preventing this. As part of implementing
    horse trading properly, we probably need to figure out how
    braves move.
