# Notes on excluded checks:
#
#   [abseil-no-internal-dependencies]: Currently doesn't seem to work properly,
#                                      scans inside abseil files.  This check would
#                                      be good if it were working; perhaps try it
#                                      again in the future.

# TODO: currently all checks are disabled; re-enable them gradually.
